## Critical Gotchas (Quick Reference)

1. **`z.input<>` not `z.infer<>`** for function params when schema has `.default()` — see CONVENTIONS.md §19
2. **`export type` doesn't create local bindings** — add separate `import type` for same-file use — see §20
3. **Money: catalog/GL/AP/AR=dollars (NUMERIC), orders/payments=cents (INTEGER)** — convert with `Math.round(parseFloat(price) * 100)` for catalog→orders, `(cents / 100).toFixed(2)` for POS→GL — see §21
4. **postgres.js returns RowList** — use `Array.from(result as Iterable<T>)`, never `.rows`
5. **Append-only tables** — `inventory_movements`, `audit_log`, `payment_journal_entries` are never updated/deleted
6. **Receipt snapshots are immutable** — frozen at `placeOrder`, never regenerated
7. **POS commands need idempotency INSIDE the transaction** — `checkIdempotency(tx, ...)` and `saveIdempotencyKey(tx, ...)` both use the transaction handle, not bare `db`. This prevents TOCTOU race conditions between check and save.
8. **POS layout dual-mounts both shells** — `pos/layout.tsx` mounts both Retail and F&B POS content via `next/dynamic` and toggles with CSS (`invisible pointer-events-none`). Page files (`retail/page.tsx`, `fnb/page.tsx`) return `null` — they exist only as route targets. Content lives in `retail-pos-content.tsx` / `fnb-pos-content.tsx` with `isActive` prop. Exit via router.push('/dashboard').
9. **Item typeGroup drives POS behavior** — always use `getItemTypeGroup()` from `@oppsera/shared`, never raw `item.type`
10. **POS V1 state is localStorage (except shifts)** — config, favorites are localStorage until backend APIs exist. Shifts are now server-persisted via `drawer_sessions` table with localStorage fallback for offline.
11. **Barcode scanner = keyboard wedge** — detect via keystroke timing (<50ms), dispatch `CustomEvent('barcode-scan')`; ignore when focus is in INPUT/TEXTAREA
12. **Catalog hierarchy is 4-layer in POS** — Department → SubDepartment → Category → Items; all derived from flat category list via parentId walking
13. **Tenders are append-only** — NEVER UPDATE financial fields (amount, amountGiven, changeGiven, tipAmount, status) on `tenders` table. "Reversed" is a derived state from `tender_reversals` join.
14. **Tender clientRequestId is REQUIRED** — unlike orders where it's optional, tenders mandate `clientRequestId` (not optional in schema)
15. **GL journal entries use dual allocation** — proportional method for partial tenders, remainder method for final tender. sum(debits) MUST equal sum(credits).
16. **TenderDialog z-index is 60** — above POS overlay (z-50). Uses `createPortal` to document.body, same pattern as other POS dialogs.
17. **Tip does NOT affect order.total** — tip is stored on the tender row only; it affects GL (debit side + Tips Payable credit) but not order financial summary
18. **Inventory on-hand is ALWAYS computed** — on-hand = SUM(quantity_delta) from inventory_movements. Never store it as a mutable column. Use `getOnHand()` helper.
19. **Inventory movements are append-only** — never UPDATE or DELETE from `inventory_movements`. Corrections are new rows (adjustment, void_reversal).
20. **Package items deduct COMPONENTS, not the package** — detect via `packageComponents?.length > 0` on order lines. Multiply component qty by line qty for the delta.
21. **Transfer always enforces non-negative at source** — regardless of `allowNegative` setting on the inventory item. Only manual adjustments respect `allowNegative`.
22. **Inventory idempotency uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING** — the UNIQUE index on (tenantId, referenceType, referenceId, inventoryItemId, movementType) WHERE referenceType IS NOT NULL prevents duplicate deductions from event replays.
23. **Always use parameterized SQL** — never string-interpolate user input into SQL. Use Drizzle `sql` template literals: `` sql`column = ${value}` `` not `` `column = '${value}'` ``. Template literals auto-parameterize.
24. **Token refresh is deduplicated** — `apiFetch` stores a single `refreshPromise` so concurrent 401s share one refresh call. Always clear tokens on final 401 failure.
25. **dotenv loading order matters** — for scripts reading `.env.local`, load it first: `dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' })` then `dotenv.config()` as fallback. The first load wins for duplicate keys.
26. **AR transactions are append-only** — like inventory movements and GL entries. Never UPDATE/DELETE from `ar_transactions`. Corrections are new rows (credit_memo, writeoff).
27. **Billing credit limits use helper functions** — `checkCreditLimit(tx, accountId, amount)` validates available credit = creditLimit - outstandingBalance. Call inside the transaction.
28. **Customer merge is soft** — merged customer gets `displayName = '[MERGED] ...'` and `metadata.mergedInto = primaryId`. Queries exclude merged records by filtering `NOT displayName LIKE '[MERGED]%'` or checking metadata.
29. **ProfileDrawer is portal-based** — uses `createPortal` to `document.body` (same pattern as POS dialogs), NOT Radix/shadcn Dialog. 560px slide-in from right with `z-50`.
30. **ProfileDrawer state is React Context** — `ProfileDrawerProvider` wraps the dashboard layout; access via `useProfileDrawer().open(customerId, { tab, source })`.
31. **Customer profile queries are sub-resource scoped** — profile360 fetches overview, then each tab lazy-loads its own sub-resource endpoint (e.g., `/profile/financial`, `/profile/compliance`).
32. **Customer preferences are grouped by category** — categories: food_beverage, golf, retail, service, facility, general, dietary, communication, scheduling. Source: manual/inferred/imported with confidence percentage.
33. **Household tree uses Unicode branch chars** — `HouseholdTreeView` renders primary member with crown icon, clickable member names open their profile in the drawer.
34. **Customer `metadata` is `Record<string, unknown>`** — always coerce with `!!` for conditional rendering and `String()` for value props to avoid `unknown` type errors in strict TS.
35. **Drizzle `numeric` columns return strings** — `numeric(10,4)` columns (e.g., `order_lines.qty`) are returned as strings by postgres.js (e.g., `"1.0000"`). Always convert with `Number()` in query mappings before returning to frontend. String `"1.0000" !== 1` is `true`, causing display bugs.
36. **Query mappings must include ALL frontend-needed fields** — When mapping DB rows in `getXxx()` queries, never omit nullable columns. Omitted fields are `undefined` in JS, and `undefined !== null` is `true` (strict equality), causing rendering bugs (e.g., `formatMoney(undefined)` = `$NaN`). Always map with `?? null`.
37. **Percentage values: store as raw percentage, not basis points** — For discounts and service charges, store the percentage as-is (10 for 10%). Don't multiply by 100. Keeps storage consistent between charges and discounts, and simplifies display. For fixed dollar amounts, store as cents.
38. **Service charges apply AFTER discounts** — Percentage service charges use `(subtotal - discountTotal)` as base, not raw `subtotal`. Order of operations: discount first, then service charge on the discounted amount.
39. **Dark mode enforcement (CRITICAL)** — Dark mode is the DEFAULT. The gray scale IS inverted (`gray-900` = near-white, `gray-50` = dark). Non-gray colors (red, green, blue, amber, indigo) are NOT inverted. BANNED: `bg-white` (use `bg-surface`), `bg-{color}-50/100` (use `bg-{color}-500/10`), `text-{color}-800/900` (use `text-{color}-500`), `border-gray-200/300` (use `border-border`), `hover:bg-gray-50` (use `hover:bg-accent`), `dark:` prefixes (not supported), `text-gray-900` (use `text-foreground`), `text-gray-400/500` (use `text-muted-foreground`), `placeholder-gray-*` (use `placeholder:text-muted-foreground`). Correct patterns: status badges = `bg-{color}-500/10 text-{color}-500 border-{color}-500/30`, cards/dialogs = `bg-surface border-border`, inputs = `bg-surface border-input text-foreground`. Exceptions: `text-white` on colored buttons, `bg-white` on toggle knobs, colors inside SVGs/Konva. See CONVENTIONS.md "Dark Mode" section for full conversion table.
40. **Never add cross-module dependencies in package.json** — modules in `packages/modules/` must ONLY depend on `@oppsera/shared`, `@oppsera/db`, and `@oppsera/core`. Never add `module-orders`, `module-catalog`, etc. as a dependency of another module. Use events or internal read APIs instead.
41. **Never import another module's internal helpers** — if multiple modules need `checkIdempotency`, `fetchOrderForMutation`, etc., move them to `@oppsera/core`. Never import from `@oppsera/module-X/helpers/*` in `@oppsera/module-Y`.
42. **Never query another module's tables in event consumers** — event consumers receive all needed data in the event payload. Don't reach into other modules' tables. If more data is needed, enrich the event payload or use an internal read API.
43. **Every page must be mobile-responsive** — all dashboard pages must work on 320px+ screens. Use responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`). POS pages target tablets (768px+). See CONVENTIONS.md §46.
44. **`prepare: false` is REQUIRED for Supavisor** — postgres.js must set `prepare: false` when using Supabase's connection pooler (Supavisor) in transaction mode. Without this, prepared statements fail silently or error.
45. **Connection pool `max: 2` on Vercel** — Vercel spins many concurrent instances; each gets a tiny pool. Never set `max` higher than 2-3 in serverless. Total connections = instances × max.
46. **`withTenant()` uses SET LOCAL** — `set_config('app.current_tenant_id', tenantId, true)` is transaction-scoped (`true` = SET LOCAL). Safe with PgBouncer/Supavisor transaction mode — auto-clears on commit/rollback.
47. **Never cache stock levels** — inventory on-hand is always computed from `SUM(quantity_delta)`. Caching introduces stale reads and double-deduction risks. Always query live.
48. **Defer partitioning until 50M+ rows** — partition only when a single table exceeds 50M rows AND index scans show >100ms P95. Use date-based monthly partitioning, NOT tenant-based (too many partitions).
49. **Vercel Cron for outbox drain** — the outbox worker runs in-process via `instrumentation.ts`, but Vercel cold starts can leave gaps. Add a Vercel Cron job pinging `/api/v1/internal/drain-outbox` every minute as safety net.
50. **Event payloads must be self-contained** — consumers should NEVER query other modules' tables. If a consumer needs data not in the event, enrich the event payload at publish time. All cross-module consumer violations have been resolved via payload enrichment.
51. **Background jobs use SKIP LOCKED** — `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` ensures multiple workers never claim the same job. No external queue dependency needed at Stage 1.
52. **Tenant fairness in job workers** — cap `maxJobsPerTenantPerPoll` to prevent a single tenant from monopolizing the job queue. Default: 5 jobs per tenant per poll cycle.
53. **Never K8s before Docker Compose proves insufficient** — K8s adds operational complexity. Only migrate when: >10 services, need custom-metric auto-scaling, team has K8s experience, monthly spend >$2K.
54. **DevAuthAdapter has production guard** — `get-adapter.ts` checks `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` in addition to `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS`. This prevents accidental auth bypass in production if env vars leak.
55. **Optional dependencies use runtime string concatenation** — for packages like `@sentry/nextjs` and `ioredis` that may not be installed, use `const pkg = '@sentry/' + 'nextjs'; require(pkg)` to prevent webpack from statically resolving and failing the build. Always wrap in try/catch.
56. **Public health endpoint returns minimal info** — `/api/health` only returns `{ status: "healthy" | "unhealthy" }`. Detailed diagnostics (DB latency, cache ratio, commit SHA) are at `/api/admin/health` behind auth. Never expose infrastructure details publicly.
57. **Event type regex allows multi-segment names** — `^[a-z][a-z_]*(\.[a-z][a-z_]*)+\.v\d+$` supports event types like `catalog.item.tax_groups.updated.v1` (5+ segments). Don't assume exactly 4 segments.
58. **Vitest `clearAllMocks()` does NOT clear `mockReturnValueOnce` queues** — only `mockReset()` clears them. If tests configure more mock returns than consumed, the leftovers leak into the next test. Always use `mockReset()` for mocks with `mockReturnValueOnce` chains.
59. **Sentry config files are staged, not active** — `apps/web/sentry-config/` contains ready-to-use configs but `@sentry/nextjs` is NOT installed. To activate: `pnpm -F @oppsera/web add @sentry/nextjs`, move files back to project root, and uncomment imports in `instrumentation.ts`.
60. **`next.config.ts` — no `instrumentationHook` needed in Next.js 15** — Next.js 15 auto-discovers `src/instrumentation.ts` without `experimental.instrumentationHook`. Remove it if present (it causes a type error).
61. **All workspace module imports must be explicit in `package.json`** — even if pnpm hoists them. Add `"@oppsera/module-X": "workspace:*"` to every consuming package's `dependencies`. Required for Docker builds and strict pnpm configs.
62. **Vercel cost crossover is at ~2K-3K locations, not ~100** — Supabase Pro now includes read replicas and PITR add-ons (was Team-only). Team ($599/mo) is only needed for SOC2/SAML compliance. Vercel function limits are 800s timeout, 4GB memory, 30K concurrent (not 60s/1GB/1K). See `infra/LIMITS_AND_MIGRATION.ts`.
63. **Migration is 80% env-var-driven** — `deployment.ts` auto-detects Vercel vs container vs local, adjusts pool size automatically. Feature flags (`USE_READ_REPLICA`, `USE_CONTAINER_WORKERS`, `USE_REDIS_CACHE`) enable gradual rollout. DB migration = change `DATABASE_URL` only.
64. **Vercel runtime log retention is 1 day** — ship logs to external aggregator from day 1. This is a launch requirement, not a nice-to-have. Enterprise only extends to 3 days.
65. **Supabase compute tiers are independent of Pro vs Team** — Pro with Medium compute ($60/mo) gets 120 direct connections, 600 pooler connections, 100GB max DB. No need for Team ($599/mo) just for database features.
66. **Function invocation overages are the Vercel cost killer at scale** — $0.60/million invocations. At 4M/mo (Stage 4), that's $1,800/mo in overages alone. Cache read-heavy endpoints aggressively.
67. **All auth endpoints have rate limiting** — login/refresh: 20/15min, signup/magic-link: 5/15min. Uses in-memory sliding window (`packages/core/src/security/rate-limiter.ts`). Upgrade to Redis in Stage 2. Returns 429 with `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers.
68. **Security headers are in next.config.ts** — CSP (with dynamic dev/prod script-src), HSTS, X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy. Never weaken CSP without a security review.
69. **Auth events are audit-logged** — `auth.login.success`, `auth.login.failed`, `auth.signup.success`, `auth.logout` via `auditLogSystem()`. Best-effort (wrapped in try/catch) — never blocks auth response.
70. **DB pool config is env-var-driven** — `DB_POOL_MAX` (default 5), `DB_ADMIN_POOL_MAX` (default 3), `DB_PREPARE_STATEMENTS` (default false). Set `DB_POOL_MAX=2` on Vercel, `DB_POOL_MAX=10` + `DB_PREPARE_STATEMENTS=true` on containers with direct Postgres.
71. **Permission cache TTL is 15 seconds** — reduced from 60s for faster permission revocation. When a user is demoted/terminated, their stale access window is at most 15s. Future: add immediate invalidation webhook.
72. **set_config scope must be transaction-scoped** — always use `set_config(key, value, true)` (third param = `true` for SET LOCAL). Session-scoped (`false`) leaks between pooled connections. `withTenant()` already does this correctly.
73. **Read model tables use `rm_` prefix** — all reporting/CQRS read models are prefixed `rm_` (e.g., `rm_daily_sales`). They are projections updated by event consumers, never by user commands directly.
74. **Read model monetary columns use NUMERIC(19,4), not cents** — unlike order-layer tables (cents as INTEGER), read models store aggregated dollar amounts as `NUMERIC(19,4)` since they are reporting summaries, not transactional amounts. Always convert with `Number()` when returning to frontend.
75. **Read models use upsert-by-natural-key** — each `rm_` table has a UNIQUE composite index on its natural key (e.g., `tenant_id + location_id + business_date`). Consumers use `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` to increment/decrement aggregates atomically.
76. **processed_events has tenant_id** — the `processed_events` table was enhanced with `tenant_id` for tenant-scoped consumer idempotency. Consumers check `(tenant_id, consumer_name, event_id)` before processing.
77. **Reporting consumers use atomic idempotency** — each consumer does `INSERT INTO processed_events ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING id` as the first statement inside `withTenant`. If RETURNING is empty, event was already processed → skip. This is stronger than the bus-level `checkProcessed` because it's inside the same transaction as the read model upsert.
78. **Business date uses day-close-time offset** — `computeBusinessDate(occurredAt, timezone, dayCloseTime?)` subtracts the day-close offset (default `'00:00'`) from the UTC timestamp before converting to local date. Events between midnight and dayCloseTime belong to the previous business day.
79. **Voids don't decrement orderCount** — `handleOrderVoided` increments `voidCount`/`voidTotal` and subtracts from `netSales`, but does NOT touch `orderCount`. `avgOrderValue` is recomputed as `netSales / orderCount` with the original count.
80. **Reporting consumers use raw SQL, not Drizzle fluent API** — `tx.execute(sql`...ON CONFLICT...DO UPDATE SET col = col + ${value}...`)` because Drizzle's `onConflictDoUpdate` doesn't support `EXCLUDED` column references or arithmetic on existing values.
81. **Multi-location aggregation recomputes avgOrderValue** — when aggregating daily sales across locations, `avgOrderValue = SUM(netSales) / SUM(orderCount)`. Never sum per-location avgOrderValue — that's a mathematical error (average of averages ≠ true average).
82. **CSV export uses UTF-8 BOM** — `toCsv()` prepends `\uFEFF` (BOM) so Excel auto-detects UTF-8 encoding. Without BOM, Excel may interpret as ANSI and mangle non-ASCII characters.
83. **Report API routes use two permission levels** — `reports.view` for JSON data queries, `reports.export` for CSV downloads. Both require the `reporting` entitlement. This allows operators to grant dashboard access without export capability.
84. **Vendor name uniqueness uses `name_normalized`** — `LOWER(TRIM(name))` stored in `name_normalized` column with UNIQUE constraint `(tenant_id, name_normalized)`. Always recompute and check on create/update/reactivate. Use `normalizeVendorName()` from `services/vendor-name.ts`.
85. **Vendors are soft-deleted, never hard-deleted** — set `isActive = false` via `deactivateVendor()`. Queries filter by `isActive` by default. Reactivation re-checks name uniqueness against active vendors.
86. **Vendor catalog items (`item_vendors`) use soft-delete** — `isActive` boolean, never hard DELETE. `deactivateVendorCatalogItem()` sets `isActive = false`. Re-adding a deactivated mapping reactivates the existing row.
87. **postReceipt() auto-updates vendor item costs** — Rule VM-4: inside the postReceipt transaction, `updateVendorItemCostAfterReceipt()` upserts `item_vendors.last_cost`, `last_received_at`, and `vendor_cost`. Auto-creates the row if vendor+item pair doesn't exist.
88. **Receipt posting recomputes everything from scratch** — Rule VM-5: server recomputes all line calculations (extendedCost, baseQty, shipping allocation, landedCost, landedUnitCost) before posting. Client-side values are previews only.
89. **Shipping allocation remainder distribution** — after proportional split (rounded to 4dp), remainder cents are distributed one-by-one to lines ordered by extendedCost DESC, tie-break by id ASC. Sum of allocated amounts MUST exactly equal shippingCost.
90. **Only one preferred vendor per item** — `addVendorCatalogItem` and `updateVendorCatalogItem` enforce single preferred vendor per inventoryItemId. Setting `isPreferred = true` clears all others in the same transaction.
91. **Receipt lifecycle is status-based** — DRAFT → POSTED → VOIDED. No hard deletes. Draft receipts can be edited/deleted. Posted receipts can only be voided. Voided receipts are immutable.
92. **Purchase orders use optimistic locking** — `version` column on `purchase_orders`, incremented on each mutation. PO revision snapshots (JSONB) are created when editing submitted/sent POs.
93. **Circular import avoidance between schema files** — `purchasing.ts` imports from `receiving.ts` (for vendors, itemVendors). The reverse link (`receiving_receipts.purchase_order_id → purchase_orders`) is a plain text column in Drizzle with FK added via ALTER TABLE in migration only.
94. **Receiving money stored as NUMERIC(12,4) in dollars** — unlike orders (cents as INTEGER), receiving/purchasing amounts are `NUMERIC(12,4)` dollars (same convention as reporting read models). Always convert with `Number()` in query mappings.
95. **POS catalog uses single-query loader** — `getCatalogForPOS` in `packages/modules/catalog/src/queries/get-catalog-for-pos.ts` loads the full catalog in one optimized query via `POST /api/v1/catalog/pos`. Don't use multiple individual category/item API calls in POS context.
96. **Golf reporting is a separate module** — `packages/modules/golf-reporting/` is independent from `packages/modules/reporting/`. It has its own schema (`golf-reporting.ts`), consumers, queries, and KPI modules. Don't mix golf-specific read models with the core reporting `rm_` tables.
97. **Archive semantics replace isActive boolean** — catalog items use `archivedAt IS NULL` for active status, NOT a boolean `isActive` column. The `isActive` column was dropped in migration 0061. Use `archiveItem` / `unarchiveItem` commands. Archived items have `archivedAt`, `archivedBy`, and `archivedReason` fields.
98. **`catalog_item_change_logs` is append-only** — RLS enforces SELECT + INSERT only (no UPDATE or DELETE policies). The `logItemChange()` function runs inside the same `publishWithOutbox` transaction as the mutation. It skips the insert if `computeItemDiff()` returns null (no actual changes).
99. **Receiving frontend uses pure calculation library** — `apps/web/src/lib/receiving-calc.ts` contains pure functions for line totals, shipping allocation, and receipt summary. These are client-side previews only — server recomputes everything on post (Rule VM-5). Keep calculations pure (no side effects, no API calls).
100. **Freight mode determines shipping handling** — ALLOCATE mode distributes `shippingCost` across receipt lines proportionally (by extendedCost). EXPENSE mode books shipping as a separate GL expense, not included in landed cost. Set via `freightMode` on `receivingReceipts` (migration 0064).
101. **Trigram GIN indexes for search** — migration 0062 adds `pg_trgm` GIN indexes on `catalog_items(name)`, `catalog_items(sku)`, `item_identifiers(value)`, and `vendors(name)` for fast substring search via `ILIKE '%term%'`. These replace sequential scans on receiving item search.
102. **Supabase local dev** — `supabase/` directory contains `config.toml` for local Postgres v17 + pooler. Use `npx supabase start` for local DB + auth. Database URL for local dev: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres`.
103. **Stock UI lives in catalog item detail page, not a separate page** — The Stock Levels page was deleted. All stock data (on-hand, movements, receive/adjust/shrink) is shown via `StockSection` component in `/catalog/items/[id]`. The data architecture stays split: `catalog_items` (global) + `inventory_items` (per-location). Only the UI was unified.
104. **POS catalog auto-refreshes every 5 minutes** — `useCatalogForPOS` periodically fetches fresh data so archived items are removed during long shifts. Additionally, `usePOS` accepts `onItemNotFound` callback — triggered on 404 from `addItem`, which pages wire to `catalog.refresh()` for immediate stale-item purge.
105. **`useInventoryForCatalogItem` resolves catalog→inventory** — Takes `(catalogItemId, locationId?)` and returns the inventory item with computed on-hand, or `null` when no inventory record exists at that location. Backend: `getInventoryItemByCatalogItem` query. API: `GET /api/v1/inventory/by-catalog-item`.
106. **Inventory dialogs are portal-based extracted components** — `receive-dialog.tsx`, `adjust-dialog.tsx`, `shrink-dialog.tsx` in `apps/web/src/components/inventory/`. Each takes `{ open, onClose, inventoryItemId, onSuccess }`. Uses `createPortal` to `document.body`, z-50. Shared between catalog item detail page and any future usage.
107. **Every dashboard page uses code-split pattern** — `page.tsx` is a thin wrapper: `dynamic(() => import('./xxx-content'), { loading, ssr: false })`. Heavy content lives in `*-content.tsx`. This ensures route transitions commit instantly (loading skeleton appears) while the JS chunk loads async. Never put heavy logic directly in `page.tsx`.
108. **Dashboard sidebar is z-40, main content is z-0** — desktop sidebar has `relative z-40` to stay above POS overlay backdrops (z-30). Main content area has `relative z-0` to create a stacking context that scopes POS `fixed`/`absolute` overlays. Portals to `document.body` (z-50/z-60) are unaffected.
109. **POS portal dialogs must close on mode switch** — when `isActive` becomes false, a `useEffect` in each POS content component sets all dialog states to `false`. Without this, `createPortal` dialogs render outside the CSS-hidden container and remain visible on top of the other POS mode.
110. **Category hooks share a module-level cache** — `_catCache` in `use-catalog.ts` deduplicates concurrent category API calls via shared promise + 30s TTL. `useDepartments`, `useSubDepartments`, `useCategories` all call `useAllCategories()` which filters in-memory. Never fetch categories individually.
111. **Dashboard uses reporting read models for KPIs** — `GET /api/v1/reports/dashboard` returns pre-aggregated metrics from `rm_daily_sales` and `rm_inventory_on_hand` tables. Never fetch raw orders/inventory for dashboard KPI cards — that's 100x slower. Dashboard also uses sessionStorage caching with business-date invalidation.
112. **`listItems` supports `includeInventory` flag** — when `true`, the backend batch-fetches `inventory_items` + computes `SUM(quantity_delta)` on-hand in the same transaction. Returns `inventoryItemId`, `onHand`, `reorderPoint` on each item. Eliminates the need for a separate inventory API call on the catalog list page.
113. **Dashboard uses React Query for data fetching** — `dashboard-content.tsx` uses `useQuery` with `({ signal })` pattern for automatic AbortSignal cancellation. When user navigates away, all in-flight dashboard requests are cancelled instantly. `QueryProvider` wraps the dashboard layout with `staleTime: 30_000`, `gcTime: 5 * 60 * 1000`. Never use raw `useEffect` + `apiFetch` for dashboard data — use React Query.
114. **Register tab orderId clearing is ONLY via `clearActiveTab()`** — the sync-back effect in `use-register-tabs.ts` must NEVER auto-clear `orderId` when `pos.currentOrder` is null. During POS remount, `currentOrder` is temporarily null while the order fetch is in-flight — auto-clearing would break the `tab → order → customer` chain. All order-clearing paths (payment, void, hold) already explicitly call `clearActiveTab()`.
115. **`clearActiveTab()` clears both `orderId` AND `label`** — after payment/void/hold, the customer name stored in `tab.label` must be wiped along with `orderId`. The label came from the customer attachment and should not persist across orders.
116. **POS loading paths use `isSwitching` guard** — when `useRegisterTabs` loads from cache or server, `isSwitching.current = true` blocks the sync-back effect during the rehydration window. Released via `requestAnimationFrame` after order fetches are dispatched. Without this, the sync-back effect races with order rehydration and clears orderId.
117. **`placeOrder()` recovers from "already placed" 409** — when a preemptive placeOrder races with handleSubmit, the second call gets a 409. Instead of clearing the order via `handleMutationError`, `doPlace()` catches the 409, fetches the placed order, and returns it as success. TenderDialog's `handleSubmit` also has a fallback: on placeOrder failure, it re-fetches the order and continues if status is 'placed'.
118. **TenderDialog preemptive placeOrder pattern** — when TenderDialog opens, it fires `onPlaceOrder()` in a useEffect so the order is placed by the time the user enters an amount and clicks Pay. `handleSubmit` awaits `placePromiseRef.current` (the preemptive promise) to avoid double-calling. Both `placeOrder()` (via `placingPromise.current`) and TenderDialog (via `placePromiseRef.current`) deduplicate concurrent place calls.
119. **`vercel.json` must not duplicate Vercel Dashboard settings** — When the Dashboard sets `rootDirectory: apps/web`, any `outputDirectory`, `buildCommand`, or `installCommand` in `vercel.json` are resolved *relative to that root*. Setting `outputDirectory: "apps/web/.next"` creates a double-nested path (`/vercel/path0/apps/web/apps/web/.next`) and breaks the build. Keep `vercel.json` minimal — only `$schema` and `regions`. All build/install/output/framework settings live in the Dashboard (or Vercel API) only. **Correct Dashboard settings for this monorepo**: Root Directory = `apps/web`, Framework = Next.js, Install Command = `cd ../.. && pnpm install`, Build Command = `cd ../.. && pnpm turbo build --filter=@oppsera/web...`, Output Directory = default (leave blank).
120. **`db:seed` does NOT create Supabase Auth users** — the seed creates app-level DB records only (`users` table, memberships, etc.) and leaves `users.auth_provider_id` as null. The production `SupabaseAuthAdapter.validateToken()` looks up users by `auth_provider_id` — if it's null, login silently fails even with valid Supabase credentials (the frontend just clears the form). To fix for a new environment: (1) create the Supabase Auth user via admin API (or confirm it already exists), (2) update the app's users table to link the UUID. Quick recovery commands:
   ```bash
   # 1. Find the Supabase Auth UUID for the user
   curl "$SUPABASE_URL/auth/v1/admin/users" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
   # 2. Reset their password if needed
   curl -X PUT "$SUPABASE_URL/auth/v1/admin/users/<uuid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"password":"<newpassword>"}'
   # 3. Link the UUID to the app's users table
   curl -X PATCH "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/users?email=eq.<email>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"auth_provider_id":"<uuid>"}'
   ```
   `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true` bypasses all of this on localhost — lookup is by email only, password ignored.
121. **`computePackageAllocations` lives in `@oppsera/shared`, not a module** — pure math, no DB, no side effects. Lives at `packages/shared/src/utils/package-allocation.ts`, exported from `@oppsera/shared`. Import it from any module without violating cross-module rules. Do NOT place pure allocation logic in a module package — it can't be shared from there.
122. **`addLineItem` now populates `packageComponents` for ALL packages** — previously always `null`, now enriched with `componentUnitPriceCents`, `componentExtendedCents`, `allocatedRevenueCents`, and `allocationWeight` for every package item. This activated the existing inventory component deduction in the inventory consumer (gotcha #20) for both `fixed` and `sum_of_components` pricing modes. For `fixed` mode, component prices are fetched live from catalog at order time.
123. **Package component prices are fetched outside the transaction** — `addLineItem` resolves component prices (via `catalogApi.getEffectivePrice()`, batched with `Promise.all`) before entering the `publishWithOutbox` transaction. This avoids N serial DB round-trips inside the transaction and prevents lock contention. Always keep non-mutating reads outside the transaction boundary.
124. **Reporting consumer splits component revenue for enriched packages** — `handleOrderPlaced` checks `packageComponents[0].allocatedRevenueCents != null`. If present, records each component separately in `rm_item_sales` using `allocatedRevenueCents / 100` as dollars. If absent (old packages, null components), falls back to recording the package line itself — backward-compatible.
125. **Semantic registry uses stale-while-revalidate (SWR) caching** — `getCache()` in `registry.ts` returns stale data for up to 10 minutes (SWR_WINDOW_MS) while refreshing in background after the 5-minute TTL (CACHE_TTL_MS). Requests within TTL return immediately. Requests in the SWR window return stale data and kick off a non-blocking refresh. Requests older than SWR_WINDOW_MS block and refresh synchronously. Call `invalidateRegistryCache()` after `syncRegistryToDb()` to force a fresh load.
126. **Semantic query cache key includes tenant + SQL + params** — `getFromQueryCache(tenantId, sql, params)` uses a djb2 hash of all three. Same SQL with different tenants or params = different keys. Max 200 entries, 5-minute TTL, LRU eviction. Call `invalidateQueryCache(tenantId?)` to flush. The pipeline auto-sets the cache after each successful DB execution.
127. **Semantic rate limiter is per-tenant sliding window** — `checkSemanticRateLimit(tenantId)` defaults to 30 requests/minute per tenant. Returns `{ allowed, remaining, resetAt, retryAfterMs }`. The `/api/v1/semantic/ask` route checks this before running the pipeline and returns 429 with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers when blocked.
128. **Semantic observability uses in-memory metrics** — `recordSemanticRequest()` accumulates per-tenant stats (p50/p95 latency, cache hit rate, token usage, error rate). View via `GET /api/v1/semantic/admin/metrics` (requires `semantic.admin` permission). Reset with `resetSemanticMetrics()` in tests. Stage 2: emit via OTLP.
129. **Sync registry before first deploy** — run `pnpm --filter @oppsera/module-semantic semantic:sync` after running migrations 0070-0073. This seeds metrics, dimensions, relations, system lenses, and eval examples. Without this, the semantic layer has no registry data and all queries return "Unknown metric" errors.
130. **Custom lenses use partial unique indexes** — `semantic_lenses` has two partial unique indexes: `uq_semantic_lenses_system_slug` (slug WHERE tenant_id IS NULL) for system lenses, and `uq_semantic_lenses_tenant_slug` (tenant_id, slug WHERE tenant_id IS NOT NULL) for custom tenant lenses. A tenant can create a lens with the same slug as a system lens — they coexist. The custom lens takes priority in GET lookups.
131. **Pipeline `vi.mock` for cache and metrics in tests** — when testing pipeline.ts behavior, always mock `../../cache/query-cache` (return null from `getFromQueryCache`) and `../../observability/metrics` (stub `recordSemanticRequest`). Without these mocks, cache state leaks between tests and causes non-deterministic failures (gotcha #58 applies here too).
132. **Narrative LLM output is direct markdown, not JSON** — the narrative system prompt instructs the LLM to respond in markdown only. `parseNarrativeResponse()` tries JSON first (backward compat), then falls through to `parseMarkdownNarrative()` which splits on `##`/`###` headings. Never instruct the narrative LLM to return JSON — it produces worse output and parsing failures.
133. **THE OPPS ERA LENS section types must match `HEADING_TO_SECTION` mapping** — the `HEADING_TO_SECTION` record in `narrative.ts` maps lowercase heading text to `NarrativeSection.type`. If the LLM uses an unmapped heading, it falls through to type `'detail'`. When adding new section types: (1) add to `NarrativeSection.type` union in `types.ts`, (2) add heading→type mapping in `HEADING_TO_SECTION`, (3) add a test in `pipeline.test.ts`.
134. **Pipeline calls LLM for 0-row results (ADVISOR MODE)** — `runPipeline()` always calls `generateNarrative()` even when `queryResult.rowCount === 0`. The system prompt's DATA-FIRST DECISION RULE handles this: "If no data exists → use industry best practices, market benchmarks, and operational heuristics." `buildEmptyResultNarrative()` is only used as a static fallback if the LLM call itself throws.
135. **Pipeline generates ADVISOR narrative on compilation errors** — when `compilePlan()` throws, the pipeline calls `generateNarrative(null, intent, message, context, ...)` to provide helpful business advice instead of returning a raw error. This means compilation failures still consume LLM tokens (2 calls: intent + narrative).
136. **Intent resolver biases toward attempting queries** — Rule 3 in `intent-resolver.ts` only sets `clarificationNeeded = true` when the LLM genuinely cannot map ANY part of the question to available metrics. Ambiguous questions get `confidence < 0.7` and a best-effort plan. General business questions get `confidence < 0.6`. This prevents the frustrating "could you clarify?" loop.
137. **`buildNarrativeSystemPrompt` is the single source of THE OPPS ERA LENS** — all narrative behavior (tone, response structure, industry translation, adaptive depth, token rules) is defined in the system prompt built by `buildNarrativeSystemPrompt()` in `narrative.ts`. When updating the lens: edit the prompt, update `HEADING_TO_SECTION` if new sections are added, and add parser tests.
138. **Narrative maxTokens is 2048, not 1024** — THE OPPS ERA LENS produces richer responses (Options + Recommendation + Quick Wins + ROI Snapshot + What to Track + Next Steps). The `maxTokens` was bumped from 1024 to 2048 in `generateNarrative()`. Intent resolution remains at 4096.
139. **Room Layout editor uses 3-layer Konva architecture** — GridLayer (cached, not redrawn per frame), ObjectLayer (filtered by layer visibility, sorted by zIndex), UI Layer (Transformer + SelectionBox). All in `apps/web/src/components/room-layouts/editor/canvas/`.
140. **Room Layout store stage ref is module-level** — `setEditorStageRef()` / `getEditorStageRef()` live outside the Zustand store to avoid serialization issues. CanvasArea registers in a useEffect, EditorShell reads for PNG export.
141. **Room Layout objects store position in feet, dimensions in pixels** — `x`/`y` are in feet (room coordinate system), `width`/`height` are in pixels. Convert with `scalePxPerFt`. Konva renders at `x * scalePxPerFt`, `y * scalePxPerFt`.
142. **Room Layout templates use SVG thumbnails** — `TemplateThumbnail` renders a lightweight SVG preview, not a full Konva mini-stage. `computeFitScale` ensures the room fits within the thumbnail dimensions.
143. **Room Layout validation is warning-based** — out-of-bounds objects and missing table numbers are warnings, not errors. Only duplicate IDs and missing required fields are errors. `validateForPublish` returns both levels.
144. **Room Layout error boundary preserves data** — `CanvasErrorBoundary` wraps only the Konva `<Stage>`. On canvas crash, Zustand state (snapshot) is preserved. "Reload Editor" button resets the error boundary without losing data.
145. **Room Layout dialogs are portal-based** — all dialogs (SaveAsTemplate, ApplyTemplate, ModeManager, VersionHistory, CreateRoom) use `createPortal(... , document.body)` with z-50, matching the POS dialog pattern.
146. **Room Layout publish always saves draft first** — `handlePublish` in `editor-content.tsx` always calls `saveDraftApi()` before `publishVersionApi()`, regardless of `isDirty` state. After autosave sets `isDirty=false`, `draftVersionId` could be null (e.g., after a prior publish). Without the forced save, publish fails with "No draft version to publish".
147. **Room Layout template creation requires dimensions** — `createTemplateSchema` requires `widthFt` and `heightFt`. The SaveAsTemplateDialog reads these from `useEditorStore`. `createRoomFromTemplateApi` is a two-step process: create blank room with template dimensions → apply template snapshot.
148. **Room Layout `applyTemplateApi` sends roomId in body** — the API route is `POST /api/v1/room-layouts/templates/:templateId/apply` with `{ roomId }` in the request body (not in the URL path). The route extracts `templateId` from the URL.
149. **Room Layout editor fetches on mount** — `editor-content.tsx` calls `fetchEditor()` in a `useEffect` on mount. The `useRoomEditor` hook returns `{ data, isLoading, error, mutate: fetchEditor }` — only one call, never duplicate hook instances.
150. **Room Layout components use `bg-surface` exclusively** — no `bg-white` or `dark:` prefixed classes in any room layout component. All backgrounds use `bg-surface` for theme-aware rendering. Hover states use opacity-based colors (`hover:bg-gray-200/50`, `hover:bg-red-500/10`). Warning banners use `bg-yellow-500/10 border-yellow-500/40`. This matches the inverted gray scale pattern (gotcha #39).
151. **Room Layout actions dropdown needs no overflow-x-auto** — the room list table container must NOT have `overflow-x-auto`, as it clips the absolutely-positioned actions dropdown menu. The table is narrow enough to not need horizontal scrolling.
152. **Seeded users don't exist in Supabase Auth** — The seed script creates users in the app's `users` table but NOT in Supabase Auth (`auth.users`). Locally with `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true`, the `DevAuthAdapter` bypasses Supabase entirely so it works fine. On Vercel (production), `SupabaseAuthAdapter` calls `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` which checks Supabase Auth — users won't exist there. Use the `/api/v1/auth/link-account` endpoint (or `supabase.auth.admin.createUser()`) to create the Supabase Auth account and update `authProviderId` in the `users` table. The `authProviderId` column MUST match the Supabase Auth user's UUID (`sub` claim in JWT).
153. **`validateToken()` must re-throw DB errors, not swallow them** — On Vercel cold starts, DB connection timeouts can occur. If `validateToken()` catches ALL errors and returns `null`, DB timeouts become false 401s, which clear tokens and bounce users to login. The catch block must ONLY return `null` for `jwt.JsonWebTokenError` and `jwt.TokenExpiredError`. All other errors (DB timeouts, network errors) must be re-thrown so middleware returns 500, not 401.
154. **`login()` must block until `/api/v1/me` succeeds** — The login function must await the `/api/v1/me` call (with retries) BEFORE returning. If it fires `fetchMe()` as fire-and-forget, `router.push('/dashboard')` executes with `user=null` and the dashboard redirects back to `/login`, creating a redirect loop. Use an inline await-based retry (not `setTimeout`).
155. **Local dev and Vercel share the same Supabase project by default** — `.env.local` points `DATABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` at the remote Supabase instance. Running `pnpm db:seed` locally overwrites `authProviderId` values that were linked via Supabase Auth, breaking Vercel login. Either use `npx supabase start` for a fully local stack, or avoid re-seeding the remote DB.
156. **GL amounts are NUMERIC(12,2) in dollars** — NOT cents. Different from orders layer (INTEGER cents). Convert at boundaries: `Number(amount)` for GL, `Math.round(parseFloat(price) * 100)` for orders.
157. **Never write GL tables directly** — always use `postJournalEntry()`. The unique index on (tenantId, sourceModule, sourceReferenceId) enforces idempotent posting from adapters.
158. **Posted journal entries are immutable** — void + create reversal. Never UPDATE a posted entry's amounts or accounts.
159. **AP/AR post to GL via AccountingPostingApi** — singleton in `@oppsera/core/helpers/accounting-posting-api.ts`. Never import `@oppsera/module-accounting` from another module. Interface: `postEntry(ctx, input)`, `getAccountBalance(tenantId, accountId, asOfDate?)`, `getSettings(tenantId)`. Initialized in `apps/web/src/lib/accounting-bootstrap.ts`, wired in `instrumentation.ts`.
160. **Currency is locked to USD** — all tables have currency column defaulting to 'USD'. Posting engine rejects non-USD. Multi-currency is a future feature.
161. **Control accounts restrict posting by sourceModule** — `controlAccountType` on `gl_accounts` limits which modules can post. Manual entries to control accounts require `accounting.control_account.post` permission.
162. **POS adapter never blocks tenders** — if GL mapping is missing, skip the GL post and log to `gl_unmapped_events`. POS must always succeed. Handler: `handleTenderForAccounting` in `packages/modules/accounting/src/adapters/pos-posting-adapter.ts`.
163. **AP denormalizes balanceDue** — `ap_bills.balanceDue` is kept in sync by payment posting. Never compute it from allocations in hot paths — use the denormalized column.
164. **AR bridges existing ar_transactions** — the AR module reads from existing operational AR tables and posts to GL. It does NOT replace the existing POS house account flow.
165. **Retained earnings is semi-automatic** — current-year P&L is added to the stored retained earnings balance for the balance sheet. Year-end close creates the formal journal entry via `generateRetainedEarnings()`. Idempotent: checks for existing entry by sourceReferenceId.
166. **Close checklist is query-based** — checklist items are computed live (open drafts, unreconciled subledgers, unmapped events), not stored. Only the period status and notes are persisted in `accounting_close_periods`.
167. **AP bill lifecycle** — draft → posted → partial → paid → voided. Bills have `balanceDue` denormalized. `postBill` validates GL references and creates journal entry. `voidBill` creates reversal journal entry.
168. **AP payment lifecycle** — draft → posted → voided. Payments allocate to bills via `ap_payment_allocations`. `postPayment` updates bill `balanceDue` and `amountPaid`, creates GL journal entry. `allocatePayment` distributes across multiple bills.
169. **AR invoice lifecycle** — draft → posted → partial → paid → voided. Same pattern as AP bills but for receivables. Schema: `ar_invoices`, `ar_invoice_lines`, `ar_receipts`, `ar_receipt_allocations`.
170. **Financial statement layouts are tenant-configurable** — `financial_statement_layouts` table allows tenants to customize P&L and Balance Sheet section groupings. `financial_statement_layout_templates` provides system defaults. Layouts group accounts by `classificationIds[]` and/or `accountIds[]`.
171. **Balance sheet includes current-year net income in equity** — `getBalanceSheet()` computes current fiscal year revenue - expenses and adds it to totalEquity. This ensures A = L + E even before year-end close. `isBalanced` flag validates the equation.
172. **Sales tax liability report uses GL, not POS data** — `getSalesTaxLiability()` pulls from `tax_group_gl_defaults` → `gl_journal_lines`. Credits to tax payable = collected, debits = remitted. Net liability = collected - remitted.
173. **Accounting module has 28 tables total** — GL: gl_accounts, gl_classifications, gl_journal_entries, gl_journal_lines, gl_journal_number_counters, gl_account_templates, gl_classification_templates, accounting_settings, gl_unmapped_events, accounting_close_periods, financial_statement_layouts, financial_statement_layout_templates. Mappings: sub_department_gl_defaults, payment_type_gl_defaults, tax_group_gl_defaults, bank_accounts, gl_transaction_types, tenant_tender_types. AP: ap_bills, ap_bill_lines, ap_payments, ap_payment_allocations, ap_payment_terms. AR: ar_invoices, ar_invoice_lines, ar_receipts, ar_receipt_allocations. Vendor extensions: columns added to existing vendors table.
174. **POS adapter converts cents to dollars for GL** — POS events use cents (INTEGER), GL uses dollars (NUMERIC(12,2)). The adapter converts: `(amountCents / 100).toFixed(2)`. Always use `.toFixed(2)` when building GL line amounts from cents.
175. **AP control account resolution is two-tier** — `postBill` first checks `vendor.defaultAPAccountId`, then falls back to `settings.defaultAPControlAccountId`. AR uses tenant-level only (no customer-specific control accounts).
176. **Void requires zero allocations** — cannot void an AP bill with payment allocations or an AR invoice with receipt allocations. Must void the payment/receipt first. AP throws `BillHasPaymentsError`, AR throws `INVOICE_HAS_RECEIPTS`.
177. **Vendor credits are stored as negative bills** — AP vendor credits use the `ap_bills` table with negative `totalAmount`/`balanceDue`. GL posting reverses: Debit AP control, Credit expense. Applied against future bills via normal allocation.
178. **Denormalized `balanceDue` uses `.toFixed(2)` at update time** — AP/AR both compute `newBalance = (Number(totalAmount) - Number(newPaid)).toFixed(2)` inside the transaction. Prevents floating-point drift. Status derived: `balanceDue <= 0 ? 'paid' : 'partial'`.
179. **GL balance direction depends on `normal_balance`** — Assets/Expenses (debit-normal): `SUM(debit) - SUM(credit)`. Liabilities/Equity/Revenue (credit-normal): `SUM(credit) - SUM(debit)`. Always use this pattern in GL queries, never hardcode sign by account type.
180. **Automated GL postings use `forcePost: true`** — AP, AR, and POS adapters always set `forcePost: true` to bypass draft mode. Only manual journal entries respect `autoPostMode` from settings.
181. **Automated GL postings use `hasControlAccountPermission: true`** — the `accounting-bootstrap.ts` wiring passes this option to bypass control account permission checks for system-initiated postings.
182. **Reconciliation tolerance is $0.01** — `reconcileSubledger` considers `Math.abs(difference) < 0.01` as reconciled. Differences >= $0.01 fail the close checklist.
183. **POS adapter creates synthetic RequestContext** — event consumers that post to GL create a synthetic context with `user.id = 'system'` and `requestId = 'pos-gl-{tenderId}'`. This satisfies the `auditLog` requirement without a real user session.
184. **GL `sourceReferenceId` format by module** — POS: tender ID, AP: bill.id or payment.id, AR: invoice.id or receipt.id, retained earnings: `retained-earnings-{startDate}-{endDate}`. The unique partial index prevents double-posting.
185. **Accounting bootstrap is lazy-imported** — `accounting-bootstrap.ts` uses dynamic `await import()` for the accounting module to prevent module resolution at build time. Called once from `instrumentation.ts`.
186. **GL rounding line auto-appended** — if `sum(debits) - sum(credits)` is within `roundingToleranceCents` (default 5), the posting engine appends a line to `defaultRoundingAccountId`. Beyond tolerance throws `UnbalancedJournalError`. No rounding account configured + any imbalance also throws.
187. **AP `lineType` drives GL posting** — `expense` debits expense account, `inventory` debits inventory asset, `asset` debits fixed asset, `freight` debits freight expense. All line types credit AP control. When building AP bills, choose the correct `lineType` for proper reporting (asset purchases, landed cost allocation, etc.).
188. **Mapping coverage diagnostic** — `getMappingCoverage()` reports how many sub-departments, payment types, and tax groups have GL mappings vs don't. Powers the accounting dashboard "mapping coverage" card. Always check coverage before going live with GL posting.
189. **Legacy bridge adapter is batch + idempotent** — `migrateLegacyJournalEntries()` reads `payment_journal_entries` (old JSONB-based GL) and creates proper `gl_journal_entries`. Processes in batches of 100. Idempotent via `sourceModule: 'pos_legacy'` + `sourceReferenceId`.
190. **CONVENTIONS.md has full architecture docs for accounting** — See §66 (Accounting/GL), §67 (AP), §68 (AR), §69 (Subledger Reconciliation), §70 (Cross-Module Financial Posting). Always read these before modifying any financial module.
191. **Chat history sidebar is inline flexbox, not a portal** — `ChatHistorySidebar` is a peer of the chat column inside a `flex h-[calc(100vh-64px)]` container. Desktop: `hidden lg:flex w-80 shrink-0 border-l`. Mobile: `fixed inset-0 z-30 lg:hidden` overlay with backdrop. Do NOT use `createPortal` for the sidebar — it scrolls independently alongside the chat.
192. **`useSessionHistory` is the shared session list hook** — both `ChatHistorySidebar` and `/insights/history` page use `useSessionHistory({ limit: 20 })`. It provides `sessions`, `loadMore`, `refresh`, `hasMore`, `isLoading`, `isLoadingMore`. Call `refresh()` after sending a message (with delay — eval capture is async). Never duplicate session fetching logic.
193. **Sidebar refresh uses `refreshKey` prop pattern** — parent increments a counter after `sendMessage`, child detects via `useRefreshOnChange(key, refresh)` hook and triggers a 1-second delayed refresh. The delay accounts for async eval turn capture (fire-and-forget in the pipeline).
194. **`initFromSession()` maps DB turns to ChatMessages** — `useSemanticChat.initFromSession(dbSessionId, turns)` resets session state and maps each `LoadedTurn` to user+assistant message pairs via `evalTurnToChatMessages()`. The `LoadedTurn` interface mirrors the API response shape from `GET /api/v1/semantic/sessions/[sessionId]`.
195. **`buildQueryString()` is the shared URL param helper** — `apps/web/src/lib/query-string.ts` exports `buildQueryString(filters)` which skips undefined/null/empty values, converts booleans to `'true'`, and returns `?key=val` or `''`. All frontend hooks (`use-ap.ts`, `use-ar.ts`, `use-journals.ts`, `use-mappings.ts`) use this instead of inline `URLSearchParams`. Never duplicate query string logic.
196. **Debug and link-account endpoints return 410 Gone** — `/api/v1/auth/debug` and `/api/v1/auth/link-account` are disabled in production. They return `{ error: { code: 'GONE', message: '...' } }` with status 410. Use Supabase admin CLI for account linking instead.
197. **AR status errors are 409, not 400** — `InvoiceStatusError` and `ReceiptStatusError` both return HTTP 409 (Conflict) to match AP conventions (`BillStatusError`). Status conflicts are resource state issues, not bad user input.
198. **AR `createInvoice` validates customer exists** — before creating an invoice, the command queries the `customers` table to verify the `customerId` belongs to the tenant. Throws `NotFoundError('Customer', customerId)` if missing. This matches AP's vendor validation pattern.
199. **AR `postReceipt` throws on missing invoice** — when a receipt allocation references a non-existent invoice, `postReceipt` throws `AppError('INVOICE_NOT_FOUND', ...)` with 400 instead of silently skipping. Ensures data integrity during posting.
200. **Accounts-content uses extracted sub-components** — `AccountFilterBar` (search, status tabs, view mode toggle) and `AccountTreeView` (collapsible type sections, tree/flat rendering) are in `apps/web/src/components/accounting/`. The main `accounts-content.tsx` orchestrates state and passes props.
201. **Vitest coverage uses v8 provider** — all 16 vitest configs include `coverage: { provider: 'v8', reporter: ['text', 'json-summary', 'lcov'] }`. Run `pnpm test:coverage` for the full report via turbo. The `vitest.workspace.ts` at root defines the workspace for parallel coverage. `@vitest/coverage-v8` is installed at root and hoisted.
202. **CI runs lint → type-check → test → build** — `.github/workflows/lint-typecheck.yml` runs on push/PR to main. Uses pnpm 9, Node 20, with pnpm store caching. Build step uses placeholder Supabase env vars.
203. **GL mapping query adapts to catalog hierarchy depth** — `getSubDepartmentMappings` uses `COALESCE(parent_id, id)` to find the mappable entity: for 3-level hierarchies (Dept → SubDept → Category → Items) it maps at sub-department level; for 2-level hierarchies (Dept → Items) it maps at department level. The frontend auto-detects flat vs grouped mode. Same logic applies to coverage API and items drill-down. The `sub_department_gl_defaults.sub_department_id` column stores whatever category ID the mappable entity is — the naming is historical.
204. **`order_lines` now have `sub_department_id` and `tax_group_id`** — migration 0084 adds both nullable columns. Populated at `addLineItem` time from `posItem.subDepartmentId` (resolved via `COALESCE(parent_id, id)` on catalog categories) and `posItem.taxInfo.taxGroups[0]?.id`. These are snapshots — if the catalog hierarchy changes later, existing order lines retain the original mapping.
205. **`tender.recorded.v1` event includes `lines[]` array** — each line has `catalogItemId`, `catalogItemName`, `subDepartmentId`, `qty`, `extendedPriceCents`, `taxGroupId`, `taxAmountCents`, `costCents`, and `packageComponents`. Also includes `paymentMethod` alias for backward compat with adapters that read that field name instead of `tenderType`.
206. **POS adapter splits package revenue by component subdepartment** — when a line has enriched `packageComponents` (with `allocatedRevenueCents != null`), the adapter groups revenue by each component's `subDepartmentId` instead of the package's line-level subdepartment. Falls back to line-level for legacy packages without allocations.
207. **`expandPackageForGL` is a pure helper** — lives in `packages/modules/accounting/src/helpers/catalog-gl-resolution.ts`. Takes a line and returns `GLRevenueSplit[]` — one entry per component for packages, single entry for regular items. No DB access, no side effects.
208. **POS adapter uses `tenderType ?? paymentMethod` for field name compat** — the event emits `tenderType` (the correct field name), and also includes `paymentMethod` as an alias. The adapter resolves with `data.tenderType ?? data.paymentMethod ?? 'unknown'` for backward compatibility with older events.
209. **F&B module has full backend + frontend** — `packages/modules/fnb/` contains 103 commands, 63 queries. ~100 API routes under `/api/v1/fnb/`, React hooks (`use-fnb-floor`, `use-fnb-tab`, `use-fnb-kitchen`, `use-fnb-menu`, `use-fnb-payments`, `use-fnb-manager`, `use-fnb-close-batch`, `use-fnb-settings`, `use-fnb-reports`, `use-fnb-realtime`, `use-fnb-locks`, `use-fnb-sections`), Zustand store (`fnb-pos-store`), 60+ components across floor, tab, menu, kitchen, split, payment, manager, host, close-batch directories. Standalone pages: `/kds`, `/expo`, `/host`, `/fnb-manager`, `/close-batch`.
210. **F&B tables sync from room-layouts snapshots** — `syncTablesFromFloorPlan` in `commands/sync-tables-from-floor-plan.ts` extracts table objects from a published `CanvasSnapshot` via `extractTablesFromSnapshot()`. It creates/updates/deactivates `fnb_tables` rows to match the floor plan. Tables are linked via `roomId` + `floorPlanObjectId`.
211. **F&B read models use `rm_fnb_` prefix** — all 7 reporting tables: `rm_fnb_server_performance`, `rm_fnb_table_turns`, `rm_fnb_kitchen_performance`, `rm_fnb_daypart_sales`, `rm_fnb_menu_mix`, `rm_fnb_discount_comp_analysis`, `rm_fnb_hourly_sales`. Same upsert-by-natural-key pattern as core `rm_` tables.
212. **F&B consumers expect enriched data, not raw events** — consumer functions like `handleFnbTabClosed` take typed input objects (`FnbTabClosedConsumerData`) not raw event payloads. The wiring layer (API/web app) is responsible for enriching event data before calling consumers.
213. **F&B permissions are separate from core RBAC** — 28 F&B-specific permissions (`pos_fnb.*`) across 10 categories (floor_plan, tabs, kds, payments, tips, menu, close_batch, reports, settings, gl). Role defaults defined in `FNB_ROLE_DEFAULTS` for 6 system roles. These complement, not replace, core system permissions.
214. **F&B close batch posts GL via `buildBatchJournalLines`** — the helper in `helpers/build-batch-journal-lines.ts` constructs double-entry journal lines from Z-report data: revenue by sub-department, tax collected, tender by type, tip payable. Uses the same GL mapping resolution pattern as the POS adapter.
215. **F&B hourly sales uses INTEGER cents, not NUMERIC dollars** — `rm_fnb_hourly_sales.salesCents` stores as INTEGER (like orders), unlike other `rm_fnb_*` tables that use NUMERIC(19,4) dollars. This matches the granularity needed for hourly breakdowns.
216. **F&B offline queue is typed but not yet wired** — `helpers/offline-queue-types.ts` defines the offline operation queue (command buffering, conflict resolution, replay) as TypeScript types. The actual WebSocket/offline infrastructure is future work.
217. **F&B UX screen map is a typed spec, not UI code** — `helpers/ux-screen-map.ts` encodes screen definitions, interaction flows, wireframes, and component reuse maps as TypeScript constants. These serve as contracts/specs for frontend implementation, not actual React components.
218. **F&B entitlement key is `pos_fnb`, not `pos_restaurant`** — the registry, settings UI, business types, onboarding, seed, and all 100+ API routes use `pos_fnb`. Do not use `pos_restaurant` anywhere — it was renamed. The sidebar layout also gates F&B nav items on `pos_fnb`.
219. **F&B POS uses Zustand internal routing, not URL routes** — `fnb-pos-content.tsx` uses `useFnbPosStore().currentScreen` (floor|tab|payment|split) for instant screen switching. No route transitions — preserves dual-mount architecture. KDS, Expo, Host, Manager, Close Batch are separate Next.js pages.
220. **F&B standalone pages require `'use client'`** — all `page.tsx` files under `/(dashboard)/` that use `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` MUST have `'use client'` directive. Next.js 15 enforces this. Affected pages: `/kds`, `/kds/[stationId]`, `/expo`, `/host`, `/fnb-manager`, `/close-batch`.
221. **F&B floor plan requires migration + table sync** — after running migration `0082_fnb_table_management.sql`, the `fnb_tables` table is empty. Users must click "Sync Tables" in the floor view (or call `POST /api/v1/fnb/tables/sync`) to extract table objects from the published room layout snapshot into `fnb_tables`. Without sync, rooms appear but show "No tables."
222. **F&B design tokens are CSS custom properties** — all F&B colors, spacing, and touch targets defined in `apps/web/src/styles/fnb-design-tokens.css`. KDS large display overrides at `@media (min-width: 1280px)`, handheld at `@media (max-width: 639px)`. Imported in `pos/layout.tsx`.
223. **F&B components use `var(--fnb-*)` tokens exclusively** — never use Tailwind color classes (e.g., `text-green-500`) in F&B components. Always use inline styles with CSS custom properties: `style={{ color: 'var(--fnb-status-available)' }}`. This allows theming and consistent status colors.
224. **Profit centers = `terminal_locations` table** — the DB table is named `terminal_locations` (historical), but the domain concept is "Profit Center." The `title` column maps to `name` in the `ProfitCenter` type. All queries, commands, and API routes use the "profit center" naming. Schema: `packages/db/src/schema/terminals.ts`.
225. **Location hierarchy: Tenant → Site → Venue → Profit Center → Terminal** — `locations` table has `parentLocationId` (self-FK) and `locationType` ('site' | 'venue'). Sites have no parent. Venues must have a parent site. Profit centers attach to the most specific location. Check constraints enforce this at the DB level.
226. **Terminal session is localStorage-scoped** — `TerminalSessionProvider` stores `TerminalSession` in `localStorage('oppsera:terminal-session')`. Provides React Context with `session`, `setSession()`, `clearSession()`, `isLoading`. All POS operations depend on this context for `terminalId`, `profitCenterId`, and `locationId`.
227. **`ensureDefaultProfitCenter` is idempotent via `code='DEFAULT'`** — matches on `code` (not `title`) for stability. Returns `{ id, created: boolean }`. When found, returns no events. When created, emits `platform.profit_center.created.v1`. Used by Simple mode to auto-create a default profit center before adding terminals.
228. **Profit Centers Settings uses Simple/Advanced mode** — persisted in `localStorage('profitCenters_mode')`. Simple mode: 2-column grid (Locations + Terminals), hides profit centers panel, auto-creates Default PC on terminal add via `ensureDefaultProfitCenter`. Advanced mode: 3-column grid (Locations + Profit Centers + Terminals). Default: `'advanced'`.
229. **Site-level guardrail prevents accidental site-level profit centers** — `createProfitCenter` checks if the `locationId` is a site with child venues. If so, rejects with 422 unless `allowSiteLevel: true` is passed. Frontend shows yellow warning banner + confirmation checkbox in `ProfitCenterFormModal` when `requireSiteLevelConfirm={true}`.
230. **Admin tenant management uses `buildAdminCtx()`** — `apps/admin/src/lib/admin-context.ts` creates a synthetic `RequestContext` with `user.id = 'admin:{adminId}'` and `isPlatformAdmin: true`. Used when admin routes call core commands (createProfitCenter, createTerminal, etc.) that require `RequestContext`.
231. **`OrdersWriteApi` is a cross-module singleton** — `packages/core/src/helpers/orders-write-api.ts` defines the interface; `apps/web/src/lib/orders-bootstrap.ts` wires it via `setOrdersWriteApi()`. Allows PMS and other modules to create/modify orders without importing `@oppsera/module-orders`. Same pattern as `AccountingPostingApi` and `CatalogReadApi`.
232. **RLS `current_setting()` must be subquery-wrapped** — migration 0094 rewrites all RLS policies to use `(select current_setting('app.current_tenant_id', true))` instead of bare `current_setting(...)`. The subquery forces PostgreSQL InitPlan evaluation (once per query), not per-row re-evaluation. Always use the subquery form in new policies.
233. **Terminal selection auto-selects single options** — `useTerminalSelection` auto-selects when only one site, one venue, one profit center, or one terminal exists. Reduces clicks during onboarding. The selection screen also allows skipping if no profit centers are configured yet.
234. **Profit center API input `name` maps to DB column `title`** — the `terminalLocations` table uses `title`, but the public API and TypeScript types use `name`. All query mappings convert: `title AS name` in SQL, `name: row.title` in Drizzle. Never expose `title` in API responses.
235. **Entitlements are three-mode, not binary** — `accessMode` column: `'off'` | `'view'` | `'full'`. Use `requireEntitlementWrite(moduleKey)` for write endpoints. `isModuleEnabled()` returns `mode !== 'off'` for backward compat. Old `isEnabled` boolean is deprecated but preserved for migration.
236. **`ModuleViewOnlyError` is 403 with code `MODULE_VIEW_ONLY`** — distinct from `ModuleNotEnabledError` (`MODULE_NOT_ENABLED`). Both return 403 but frontend should show different messages ("view-only" vs "not enabled").
237. **Module dependencies block mode changes** — `validateModeChange()` returns `allowed: false` if enabling a module whose dependencies are `off`, or disabling a module that has active dependents. No auto-cascade — admin must disable dependents first.
238. **High/critical risk modules require a reason to disable** — `riskLevel === 'high' || 'critical'` sets `reasonRequired: true` in `DependencyCheckResult`. Admin UI must collect `changeReason` before submitting.
239. **`withMiddleware` `writeAccess` option** — set `{ writeAccess: true }` on POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE routes to block `view`-mode tenants. GET routes use default `requireEntitlement` which allows `view` through.
240. **F&B Floor + Tab views are CSS-mounted** — `fnb-pos-content.tsx` mounts both `FnbFloorView` and `FnbTabView` inside divs toggled with `hidden` class. Payment and Split views mount on-demand. This prevents data loss and expensive re-fetches when switching between floor and tab screens.
241. **Platform admin tables have no RLS** — `platform_admins`, `platform_admin_roles`, `platform_admin_role_permissions`, `platform_admin_role_assignments`, `platform_admin_audit_log` are NOT tenant-scoped and have NO RLS policies. They are accessed via admin routes only.
242. **Admin audit log is separate from tenant audit log** — `platform_admin_audit_log` captures admin portal actions; tenant `audit_log` captures tenant-scoped operations. Never mix them. Admin audit stores before/after JSONB snapshots.
243. **Entitlement change log is append-only** — `entitlement_change_log` tracks all mode changes. Never UPDATE or DELETE rows. Use for auditing and compliance.
244. **Order `metadata` is opaque JSONB** — `Record<string, unknown>` validated by Zod. Use for cross-module context (PMS reservation ID, etc.). Never query by metadata fields — add dedicated columns if you need to filter.
245. **Outbox worker uses `IN` not `ANY`** — migration from `ANY(${publishedIds})` to `IN (${idList})` with `sql.join()` for compatibility. Always use `sql.join()` with `sql` template literals for dynamic IN clauses in Drizzle.
246. **`seeds` create site→venue hierarchy** — seed now creates 1 site + 2 venues (not flat locations). All location-dependent seed data (profit centers, terminals) uses venue IDs, not site ID.
247. **`enableLegacyGlPosting` gates dual GL posting** — `accounting_settings.enable_legacy_gl_posting` (default `true`) controls whether `recordTender()` writes to `payment_journal_entries` (legacy JSONB-based GL). When `false`, only the proper `gl_journal_entries` path via the POS adapter is active. Toggle per tenant after validating GL reconciliation.
248. **POS adapter uses proportional + remainder allocation** — non-final tenders post `(tenderAmount / orderTotal)` share of revenue/tax/discounts/service charges. Final tender (`isFullyPaid = true`) posts `orderTotal - previouslyPosted` to prevent rounding drift. Single tenders are treated as final. Tips are per-tender (no proportional split).
249. **GL adapters NEVER throw** — all 9 adapters (`pos`, `void`, `return`, `fnb`, `voucher` x3, `membership`, `chargeback` x2) wrap their entire body in try/catch. GL failures log to console.error but never propagate — business operations (POS, vouchers, chargebacks) must always succeed regardless of GL state.
250. **GL journal line dimensions are nullable** — `profitCenterId`, `subDepartmentId`, `terminalId`, `channel` on `gl_journal_lines` are all nullable TEXT. POS adapter sets `channel = 'pos'`, F&B adapter sets `channel = 'fnb'`. Manual journal entries have no dimensions. Queries filter by dimension only when the filter value is provided.
251. **Void adapter reverses per-tender, not per-order** — `handleOrderVoidForAccounting` queries `gl_journal_entries` for each tender of the voided order and calls `voidJournalEntry()` per entry. Already-voided entries are skipped (idempotent). This handles multi-tender orders correctly.
252. **Return adapter uses `returnsAccountId` from sub-department mapping** — `handleOrderReturnForAccounting` debits `returnsAccountId` (contra-revenue) and credits the payment account. Falls back to `logUnmappedEvent` if no returns account is configured for the sub-department.
253. **F&B adapter resolves abstract categories to GL accounts** — `handleFnbGlPostingForAccounting` maps category strings (`sales_revenue`, `tax_payable`, `tips_payable`, `discount`, `comp_expense`, `cash_over_short`) from `buildBatchJournalLines()` output to GL account IDs via `fnb_gl_account_mappings` table. Falls back to `accounting_settings` defaults.
254. **Voucher GL uses lifecycle-specific sourceReferenceId** — purchase: `purchase-{voucherId}`, redeem: `redeem-{voucherId}-{tenderId}`, expire: `expire-{voucherId}`. This allows multiple redemptions of the same voucher to each get their own GL entry.
255. **Chargeback GL uses payment type mapping** — `feeExpenseAccountId` for expense side, `depositAccountId` for cash/bank side. Falls back to `defaultUndepositedFundsAccountId` from settings. Won = reversal of received. Lost with fee > 0 = fee entry. Lost with fee = 0 = no additional GL entry.
256. **Chargeback lifecycle: received → under_review → won/lost** — `resolveChargeback` validates status is `received` or `under_review` (409 if already resolved). Fee can be overridden on resolution. GL entries use sourceModule `'chargeback'` with patterns: `received-{id}`, `won-{id}`, `lost-fee-{id}`.
257. **Close checklist warns on legacy GL** — when `enableLegacyGlPosting = true`, the close checklist includes a warning item. Also validates tips payable and service charge accounts are configured, and all sub-departments have discount/returns mappings.
258. **COA templates include Tips Payable (2160) and Service Charge Revenue (4500)** — migration 0102 inserts these into `gl_account_templates` for all 4 business types. `bootstrapTenantCoa` auto-wires them to `defaultTipsPayableAccountId` and `defaultServiceChargeRevenueAccountId` in settings. Existing tenants: run `tools/scripts/backfill-accounting-accounts.ts`.
259. **Posting matrix test validates debits = credits for all adapters** — `packages/modules/accounting/src/__tests__/posting-matrix.test.ts` validates balance across voucher (purchase/redeem/expire), membership billing, chargeback (received/won/lost), and cents-to-dollars conversion accuracy. Also validates source reference ID uniqueness and never-throw guarantee.
260. **Next.js 15 `config.watchOptions` is read-only — never mutate directly** — Next.js 15.5+ freezes the `watchOptions` object passed to the webpack callback. Assigning `config.watchOptions.ignored = [...]` throws `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'ignored'`. Fix: create a new object via spread: `config.watchOptions = { ...prev, ignored: kept }`. Additionally, Next.js sets `ignored` to a RegExp internally — when merging, filter to keep only string patterns (`typeof p === 'string'`), or webpack rejects the array with `watchOptions.ignored[0] should be a non-empty string`. See `apps/web/next.config.ts` lines 43-58.
261. **Drawer sessions are server-persisted** — `drawer_sessions` + `drawer_session_events` tables in `packages/db/src/schema/drawer-sessions.ts`. `useShift` hook calls `/api/v1/drawer-sessions/` API with localStorage fallback for offline. One drawer per terminal per business date (UNIQUE constraint). Events are append-only (paid_in, paid_out, cash_drop, drawer_open, no_sale).
262. **Retail close batch lifecycle: open → in_progress → reconciled → posted → locked** — `retail_close_batches` table. `startRetailClose` aggregates sales from orders/tenders for the terminal's business date. `reconcileRetailClose` computes over/short from cash count. `postRetailClose` posts GL (Dr Cash Over/Short if variance). `lockRetailClose` freezes the batch. Cannot close without closing the drawer session first.
263. **Comp vs Discount GL separation** — Comps hit `Comp Expense` account (expense); discounts hit `Discount Account` (contra-revenue). Both reduce order total but post to different GL accounts. Comp requires manager PIN. Sub-department-specific comp accounts via `comp_account_id` on `sub_department_gl_defaults`.
264. **Returns use `isContraAccount` flag on GL accounts** — `gl_accounts.is_contra_account` marks revenue accounts as contra (e.g., Returns & Allowances). P&L shows contra accounts as deductions under parent type. Return adapter uses `returnsAccountId` from sub-dept mapping → falls back to `settings.defaultReturnsAccountId`.
265. **Card settlement lifecycle: pending → matched → posted → disputed** — `payment_settlements` + `payment_settlement_lines` tables. CSV import + manual entry. Auto-matcher links settlement lines to tenders by date range + amount. GL posting: Dr Bank + Dr Processing Fee / Cr Undeposited Funds. Idempotent via `(tenant, processor, batch_id)` unique.
266. **Tip payout GL: cash = Dr Tips Payable / Cr Cash; payroll = Dr Tips Payable / Cr Payroll Clearing** — `tip_payouts` table. Balance = SUM(tenders.tipAmount) - SUM(payouts.amount) per employee. Cannot payout more than balance. Voided payout creates GL reversal.
267. **COGS posting mode is tri-state** — `accounting_settings.cogs_posting_mode`: `'disabled'` (no COGS), `'perpetual'` (per-tender), `'periodic'` (period-end calculation). POS adapter checks mode before posting COGS lines. `periodic_cogs_calculations` table stores COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases − Ending Inventory.
268. **Tax rates have jurisdiction dimensions** — `jurisdiction_code`, `authority_name`, `authority_type` (state/county/city/district), `tax_type`, `filing_frequency` on `tax_rates`. Tax remittance report groups by jurisdiction. Backward compatible — existing rates without jurisdiction still work.
269. **F&B batch category keys are typed enum** — `FnbBatchCategoryKey` in `@oppsera/shared/src/types/fnb-gl.ts`. Category version tracked on `fnb_close_batch_summaries`. Coverage query returns mapped/unmapped per category. Critical unmapped categories block posting.
270. **Event dead letters persist to DB** — `event_dead_letters` table. After max retries (3), events land here instead of being silently dropped. Admin UI at `/events` in admin app. Retry re-publishes through full pipeline. Idempotency prevents double-processing.
271. **Deposit slips aggregate cash from all closes** — `deposit_slips` table links to retail close batch IDs + F&B close batch ID. GL: Dr Bank / Cr Cash On Hand. Cannot finalize deposit before all terminals + F&B closed. Status: pending → deposited → reconciled.
272. **Close checklist has 18+ items** — items #11-#18 added by UXOPS-12: drawer sessions closed, retail/F&B batches posted, tip balances zero, deposit slips reconciled, no dead letter events, card settlements matched, COGS posted (if periodic). All computed live from DB queries.
273. **Operations hooks use `useAuthContext` from `@/components/auth-provider`** — NOT from `@/hooks/use-auth`. The auth context providing `user`, `locations`, etc. lives in the auth provider component, not a standalone hook.
274. **Sidebar navigation lives in `apps/web/src/lib/navigation.ts`** — extracted from layout. Array of `{ name, href, icon, group }` objects. CommandPalette (`Ctrl+K`) also reads from this config. Operations link uses `Monitor` icon from lucide-react.
275. **UXOPS posting matrix test validates GL balance for all UXOPS scenarios** — `packages/modules/accounting/src/__tests__/uxops-posting-matrix.test.ts` validates retail close over/short, comp, void-line, return, settlement, tip payout (cash/payroll/void), periodic COGS, deposit slip, plus end-to-end lifecycle flows and idempotency replay tests.
276. **Bank reconciliation difference must be $0.00 to complete** — `completeBankReconciliation` validates `Math.abs(difference) < 0.01` before marking status as `completed`. Difference = (beginningBalance + clearedTotal) − statementEndingBalance. Bank adjustments (fees, interest) are always auto-cleared.
277. **Bank reconciliation auto-populates GL lines** — `startBankReconciliation` queries `gl_journal_lines` for unreconciled entries hitting the bank's GL account, excluding lines already cleared in prior completed reconciliations. Items populated as `item_type = 'gl_entry'`.
278. **Reconciliation waterfall amounts are in cents** — `getReconciliationWaterfall` returns all amounts in cents (INTEGER) matching the orders/tenders layer. Frontend converts with `formatCents()`. Variance at each stage highlights mismatches between expected and actual amounts.
279. **Recurring journal templates are draft-only until generated** — `recurring_journal_templates` store the pattern; `generateFromTemplate` creates actual `gl_journal_entries`. Templates have `nextRunDate` + `frequencyType` (monthly/quarterly/annual). Generated entries get `sourceModule = 'recurring'` + `sourceReferenceId = template-{id}-{date}`.
280. **V1 POS blocks tenders when offline** — `TenderDialog.handleSubmit()` checks `navigator.onLine` first. If offline, shows toast error and returns early. No offline queue in V1 — read-only mode only.
281. **Audit coverage diagnostic compares counts** — `getAuditCoverage(tenantId, dateRange)` compares financial transaction counts (GL entries, tenders, AP bills, AR invoices, orders) against audit log entry counts per category. Mismatches = gaps. Surfaced on accounting dashboard and at `/accounting/audit`.
282. **ReconciliationReadApi is a 25-method cross-module singleton** — `packages/core/src/helpers/reconciliation-read-api.ts` defines the interface; `apps/web/src/lib/reconciliation-bootstrap.ts` wires it via `initializeReconciliationReadApi()`, called from `instrumentation.ts`. All accounting queries that need data from orders, tenders, settlements, tips, deposits, inventory, or F&B tables MUST use `getReconciliationReadApi()` — never import those tables directly. Implementations live in each owning module's `reconciliation/index.ts`.
283. **Accounting queries MUST NOT import operational tables** — after the ReconciliationReadApi refactor, `packages/modules/accounting/src/queries/` should have ZERO imports of `orders`, `tenders`, `drawer_sessions`, `retail_close_batches`, `comp_events`, `payment_settlements`, `tip_payouts`, `deposit_slips`, `fnb_close_batches`, `inventory_movements`, `receiving_receipts`, `terminals`, or `users` from `@oppsera/db`. All cross-module reads go through `getReconciliationReadApi()`.
284. **ReconciliationReadApi uses Promise.all for parallelism** — accounting queries that previously ran sequential SQL blocks now use `Promise.all([api.method1(), api.method2(), withTenant(tenantId, localQueries)])` to run API calls and local queries concurrently. This improves latency by 2-4x on the heaviest dashboard queries.
285. **POS adapter uses fallback cascade, never drops revenue** — when a sub-department has no GL mapping, revenue posts to `defaultUncategorizedRevenueAccountId` (account 49900). When a payment type has no mapping, the debit posts to `defaultUndepositedFundsAccountId`. When a tax group has no mapping, tax posts to `defaultSalesTaxPayableAccountId`. Tips and service charges without dedicated accounts fall back to uncategorized revenue. When no line detail exists, the full tender amount posts to uncategorized revenue. Unmapped events are ALWAYS logged to `gl_unmapped_events` regardless of whether a fallback was used — preserving the "resolve later" workflow. The only scenario where posting is skipped entirely is when no fallback accounts are configured in settings (all defaults null) AND no specific mappings exist. Migration 0135 adds the `default_uncategorized_revenue_account_id` column + seeds account 49900 templates. Run `npx tsx tools/scripts/backfill-uncategorized-revenue.ts` for existing tenants.
286. **Reporting consumers must convert cents to dollars** — event payloads from `order.placed.v1`, `order.voided.v1`, and `tender.recorded.v1` contain cent amounts (INTEGER). Read model columns (`rm_daily_sales`, `rm_item_sales`) are NUMERIC(19,4) dollars. Consumers MUST divide by 100 at the boundary: `totalCents / 100` before upserting. Without this, dashboard/report values are 100x too large.
287. **Dashboard metrics use 3-tier fallback** — `getDashboardMetrics` prefers CQRS read models, falls back to operational tables with today's business date filter, then falls back to all-time orders. Labels dynamically update: "Total Sales Today" vs "Total Sales" based on data source. This handles seed data with NULL business_date or dates from other days.
288. **Transaction types use dual-table registry** — `gl_transaction_types` holds the global registry (system types with `tenant_id IS NULL` + tenant-custom types). `tenant_tender_types` holds custom payment method details (category, posting mode, GL accounts, reporting bucket). System types are seeded in migration 0144 — never INSERT into `gl_transaction_types` with `tenant_id IS NULL` from application code.
289. **Custom tender type codes must not conflict with system types** — `createTenantTenderType` validates the new code doesn't match any existing `gl_transaction_types` code (case-insensitive). Codes are `lowercase_snake_case` only. The command creates records in BOTH `tenant_tender_types` AND `gl_transaction_types` (tenant-scoped) atomically.
290. **Tender posting modes: clearing vs direct_bank vs non_cash** — `clearing`: Dr Clearing Account / Cr Revenue (card processors). `direct_bank`: Dr Bank Account / Cr Revenue (cash, checks). `non_cash`: Dr Expense Account / Cr Revenue (comps, vouchers). The `CreateTenderTypeDialog` conditionally shows different GL account pickers per mode.
291. **Onboarding auto-detection uses parallel HEAD/GET requests** — `useOnboardingStatus` fires ~15 parallel API calls with 5s timeout each to check if data exists. Uses `hasRecords()` helper that returns boolean. Cached in sessionStorage with stale-while-revalidate pattern. Never block page render on these checks.
292. **Onboarding state is localStorage + sessionStorage** — `skippedPhases` and `manuallyCompleted` steps persist in `localStorage('oppsera_onboarding_*')`. API completion cache uses `sessionStorage('oppsera_onboarding_cache')`. Completion timestamp in `localStorage('oppsera_onboarding_completed_at')`. The `SetupStatusBanner` on dashboard reads these with zero API calls.
293. **F&B floor hook uses module-level snapshot cache** — `useFnbFloor` stores snapshots in a module-level Map (outside React lifecycle) with 30-min TTL. This survives React Query garbage collection for instant cold starts via `initialData`. Polling interval is 20 minutes (floor plans rarely change during shift). `staleTime: 5min`, `gcTime: 30min`.
294. **F&B menu hook deduplicates in-flight fetches** — `useFnbMenu` uses a module-level `_menuFetchPromise` to share a single API call across concurrent hook instances. 5-minute cache TTL with automatic background refresh. Auto-selects first department on cached data via `initialDeptSetRef`.
295. **AccountPicker uses semantic grouping for suggestions** — the suggestion engine maps department/sub-department names to GL accounts via shared naming heuristics (e.g., "Sandwiches" → "Food Sales" via the `SEMANTIC_GROUPS` map). Hint-based paths (REVENUE_HINTS, COGS_HINTS, etc.) provide role-specific suggestions. Fuzzy matching uses token overlap scoring with penalty for generic accounts ("Other Revenue", "Miscellaneous").
296. **Guest Pay tokens are 256-bit base64url** — `guest_pay_sessions.token` is crypto-random, unguessable. Session lifecycle: `active` → `paid` | `expired` | `invalidated` | `superseded`. Tip settings are JSONB-snapshotted at session creation time so changes don't affect in-flight sessions.
297. **Member portal is a separate Next.js app** — `apps/member-portal/` runs independently with its own auth (`withPortalAuth()`), JWT signing (`createPortalToken()`), and multi-tenant discovery via `[tenantSlug]/` dynamic routes. It does NOT share auth with the main web app — portal tokens are a separate token type.
298. **GL remap is retroactive** — `remapGlForTender` voids the original GL journal entry and posts a new one with corrected account mappings. Idempotent via `sourceReferenceId`. `tryAutoRemap` runs automatically when `accounting_settings.enable_auto_remap = true` and a mapping is saved. Preview before executing: `POST /api/v1/accounting/unmapped-events/remap/preview`.
299. **Admin impersonation has action counting** — `admin_impersonation_sessions.action_count` increments on every API call during impersonation. Sessions auto-expire. All actions are audit-logged with `impersonation_session_id`. End via `POST /api/v1/auth/impersonate/end`.
300. **Admin role uses wildcard permissions** — admin role seed has `permissions: ['*']` (same as Owner). The only difference is admin CAN be location-scoped via `role_assignments.location_id`, while Owner is always tenant-wide. Don't enumerate individual permissions for admin — use the wildcard.
301. **Dead letter routes MUST use DB persistence** — `/api/v1/admin/events/dlq` routes read from the `event_dead_letters` table, NOT in-memory queues. In-memory state is lost on Vercel cold starts. Always use `dead-letter-service.ts` methods for DLQ operations.
302. **COA merge reassigns journal lines** — `mergeGlAccounts` moves all `gl_journal_lines` from the source account to the target account, then deactivates the source. Both accounts must have the same `normalBalance` and `accountType`. Cannot merge into a control account.
303. **COA CSV import validates before creating** — `importCoaFromCsv` parses the CSV, validates all rows (account number format, type, classification, parent references), reports errors per row, then creates accounts atomically. Invalid rows don't block valid ones — partial imports are supported.
304. **ReconciliationReadApi has 61 methods** — expanded from 25 to 61 to support GL remap, settlements, and enhanced reconciliation. New methods include `getTendersForRemapping`, `getPaymentsForRemapping`, `getTransactionsWithGlStatus`. Always check existing methods before adding new ones.
305. **F&B payment tier 3 includes house accounts** — `chargeGuestMemberAccount` debits the member's billing account (AR). Member lookup via `GET /api/v1/fnb/payments/member-lookup?search=`. Gift card balance via `GET /api/v1/fnb/payments/gift-card-balance?cardNumber=`. NFC and loyalty are stubs for V2.
306. **Semantic pipeline is now dual-mode (metrics + SQL)** — `runPipeline()` resolves intent first, then branches: Mode A (metrics) compiles via registry → executes → narrates. Mode B (SQL) generates SQL via LLM → validates → executes → auto-retries on failure → narrates. Mode selection is automatic based on intent confidence and schema availability. Both modes share the same eval capture, caching, and observability infrastructure.
307. **LLM-generated SQL has defense-in-depth validation** — `validateGeneratedSql()` in `sql-validator.ts` enforces: SELECT/WITH only, no DDL/DML/TX control, no dangerous functions (`pg_sleep`, `set_config`, etc.), no comments, no semicolons (multi-statement prevention), `tenant_id = $1` required, LIMIT required (except aggregates), table whitelist check against schema catalog. RLS is the primary security layer — validation is an additional guard. Always validate before executing.
308. **SQL auto-correction retry sends errors back to LLM** — when LLM-generated SQL fails execution, `retrySqlGeneration()` sends the failed SQL + error message back to the LLM for one correction attempt. The corrected SQL is re-validated before execution. Token counts and latency accumulate across retries. Max retries default to 1 to control cost. Never retry more than once.
309. **Semantic pipeline uses RAG few-shot retrieval** — `retrieveFewShotExamples()` in `rag/few-shot-retriever.ts` retrieves similar past queries for injection into the SQL generator system prompt. Best-effort — never blocks SQL generation on RAG failure. Supports `includeSqlMode` / `includeMetricsMode` filtering.
310. **Conversation pruning is token-aware** — `pruneForSqlGenerator()` in `conversation-pruner.ts` trims conversation history to fit within token budgets before sending to the SQL generator. Preserves the most recent messages. Different pruning strategies for intent resolution vs SQL generation.
311. **LLM response cache is separate from query cache** — `llm-cache.ts` caches narrative LLM responses keyed on `(tenantId, promptHash, userMessage + dataSummary, history)`. `query-cache.ts` caches SQL query results keyed on `(tenantId, sql, params)`. Both are in-memory LRU with TTL. Check both caches before making LLM/DB calls.
312. **Pipeline generates follow-ups, chart config, and data quality scores** — after execution + narrative, the pipeline calls `generateFollowUps()` (context-aware suggested questions), `inferChartConfig()` (auto-detect best chart type from data shape), and `scoreDataQuality()` (confidence scoring based on row count, execution time, date range, schema tables). All are optional enrichments that never block the response.
313. **SQL generator system prompt includes money conventions** — the `buildSqlGeneratorPrompt()` explicitly documents which tables use cents (orders, tenders) vs dollars (catalog, GL, read models, receiving). LLM must convert cents to dollars with `/ 100.0` when users ask about dollar amounts. Also documents status conventions, date patterns, and the critical users vs customers table distinction.
314. **PMS module follows standard module architecture** — `packages/modules/pms/` has 50+ commands, 60+ queries, state machines for reservations and rooms, event consumers for calendar/occupancy projections, background jobs (nightly charges, no-show marking, housekeeping auto-dirty), and `rm_pms_*` CQRS read models. Uses `publishWithOutbox` for all write ops.
315. **PMS uses state machines for lifecycle management** — `state-machines.ts` defines `RESERVATION_TRANSITIONS` (confirmed→checked_in→checked_out, confirmed→cancelled, confirmed→no_show) and `ROOM_STATUS_TRANSITIONS` (clean→occupied→dirty→cleaning→inspected→clean). `assertReservationTransition()` and `assertRoomTransition()` throw `InvalidStatusTransitionError` on invalid moves.
316. **PMS calendar queries return room-centric segments** — `getCalendarWeek()` and `getCalendarDay()` return rooms with reservation segments for Gantt-style rendering. `getCalendarMonth()` returns day-level occupancy summaries. Calendar queries are optimized for frontend rendering — no N+1 queries.
317. **PMS has its own idempotency + outbox tables** — `pms_idempotency_keys` and `pms_outbox` are PMS-specific (not shared with the core outbox). This allows PMS to be extracted to a microservice later without depending on the core event infrastructure.
318. **PMS pricing engine is rule-based** — `computeDynamicRate()` evaluates `pms_pricing_rules` (occupancy-based, day-of-week, lead-time, length-of-stay, demand) in priority order. `pricingConditionsSchema` validates rule conditions. `pms_pricing_log` records which rules fired for each rate calculation.
319. **PMS room assignment engine uses weighted scoring** — `scoreRoom()` evaluates rooms by floor preference, view, accessibility, loyalty tier, previous stays, and room features. `rankRooms()` returns sorted candidates. Preferences stored in `pms_room_assignment_preferences` per property.
320. **PMS schema uses `pms_` prefix on all tables** — all 50+ PMS tables are prefixed `pms_` (e.g., `pms_reservations`, `pms_rooms`, `pms_folios`). Read models use `rm_pms_` prefix. This avoids name collisions and makes the module clearly identifiable in SQL.
321. **PMS channel management syncs availability** — `pms_channels` (OTA integrations), `pms_channel_sync_log` (sync history), `pms_booking_engine_config` (direct booking). `syncChannel` command pushes availability/rates to external channels. Channel sync is async and logged for debugging.
322. **PMS loyalty is points-based** — `pms_loyalty_programs` (earn/burn rates, tiers), `pms_loyalty_members` (points balance, tier), `pms_loyalty_transactions` (earn/redeem/adjust/expire). `enrollLoyaltyGuest`, `earnLoyaltyPoints`, `redeemLoyaltyPoints`, `adjustLoyaltyPoints` commands. Redemption validates sufficient balance.
323. **PMS guest portal uses secure token sessions** — `pms_guest_portal_sessions` with expiring tokens for pre-check-in self-service. `createGuestPortalSession` generates the token, `completePreCheckin` captures guest preferences. `expireGuestPortalSessions` runs as a background job.
324. **Admin train-ai section replaces eval** — the admin sidebar now uses "Train AI" as the top-level section (was "Eval"). Sub-pages: Examples, Turns (detail), Batch Review, Comparative, Conversations, Cost Analytics, Experiments, Playground, Regression Testing, Safety. Each has corresponding API routes under `/api/v1/eval/`.
325. **Admin eval training hook centralizes all training operations** — `useEvalTraining()` in `apps/admin/src/hooks/use-eval-training.ts` provides CRUD operations for examples (including bulk import/export and effectiveness tracking), batch review workflows, experiment management, regression testing, cost analytics, safety evaluation, and conversation analysis. Single hook for all AI training features.
326. **Eval examples support bulk import/export** — `POST /api/v1/eval/examples/bulk-import` for batch creation, `GET /api/v1/eval/examples/export` for CSV/JSON export. Examples track effectiveness via `GET /api/v1/eval/examples/[id]/effectiveness`. Promoted corrections from turns create examples via `POST /api/v1/eval/turns/[id]/promote-correction`.
327. **Semantic schema catalog is built from live DB introspection** — `buildSchemaCatalog()` in `schema/schema-catalog.ts` introspects the actual database schema to build a catalog of tables, columns, and types. This is loaded in parallel with the registry catalog at pipeline start. Non-blocking — schema catalog failure falls back to metrics-only mode.
328. **Intelligence modules are post-pipeline enrichments** — `intelligence/follow-up-generator.ts`, `intelligence/chart-inferrer.ts`, `intelligence/data-quality-scorer.ts` run after query execution. They analyze the query results and plan to generate contextual follow-up questions, optimal chart configurations, and data quality scores. All are pure functions with no side effects.
329. **PMS hooks follow standard pattern** — `use-pms.ts` provides `usePmsCalendar()`, `usePmsReservations()`, `usePmsRoomTypes()`, etc. Each returns `{ data, isLoading, error, mutate }`. Mutations use `useMutation` pattern. Calendar hooks support week/day/month views with date-range parameters.
330. **Catalog module now exports modifier group queries** — `getCatalogModifierGroups` and `getModifierGroupsForItem` added to catalog query exports. Used by F&B menu panel for modifier resolution. Also exports `importInventory` command for catalog-level inventory import.
331. **Customer module expanded with Intelligent Tag System + Tag Actions Lifecycle** — 10-session build (Sessions 1-10) + lifecycle expansion: 47 condition metrics across 8 categories, 12 operators, multi-group AND/OR evaluation, 12 pre-built RFM/predictive templates with auto-matching, tag expiration service (batch processing), evidence builder (JSONB audit payloads), conflict resolver (priority-based with mutual exclusion groups), 4 analytics queries (distribution, trends, performance, correlations), suggestion engine frontend, tag action editor, analytics dashboard. **Tag actions**: `manage-tag-actions.ts` (CRUD), `tag-action-executor.ts` (runs inside evaluation transaction on apply/remove/expire/score_change), 6 action types (webhook, email, notification, segment_add, segment_remove, workflow_trigger). **Event consumers**: `tag-evaluation-consumer.ts` (fire-and-forget wrappers for order.placed, tender.recorded, customer.visit, customer.profile.updated). **Predictive services**: `predictive-metrics.ts` (custom metric computation), `rfm-scoring-engine.ts` (recency/frequency/monetary scoring with configurable buckets). Services: `smart-tag-evaluator.ts`, `smart-tag-templates.ts`, `tag-expiration-service.ts`, `tag-evidence-builder.ts`, `tag-conflict-resolver.ts`, `tag-analytics.ts`, `tag-action-executor.ts`, `predictive-metrics.ts`, `rfm-scoring-engine.ts`. 916 tests across 28+ files. Cross-system integration: POS VIP badges, reporting segmentation, marketing targeting, semantic AI dimensions.
332. **Insights page has sub-sections** — `/insights` is now a hub with sub-pages: `/insights/authoring` (semantic authoring panel), `/insights/embeds` (embeddable widgets), `/insights/reports` (NL report builder), `/insights/tools` (analysis tools), `/insights/watchlist` (metric watchlist). Each has its own content component and hooks.
333. **PMS calendar content is code-split** — `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/pms/calendar/calendar-content.tsx` follows the standard code-split pattern: thin `page.tsx` with `next/dynamic` + `ssr: false`, heavy content in separate file. PMS sub-pages (corporate, groups, loyalty, maintenance, reports, revenue-management) follow the same pattern.
334. **Import system uses a centralized registry** — `apps/web/src/lib/import-registry.ts` defines available import types (catalog, customer, staff, COA, legacy transactions). Import wizard components in `apps/web/src/components/import/` share a common flow. API routes under `/api/v1/import/` handle file upload, validation, and processing. Hooks: `use-import-wizard.ts`, `use-import-jobs.ts`, `use-import-progress.ts`, `use-import-completion.ts`.
335. **POS design tokens are in a separate CSS file** — `apps/web/src/styles/pos-design-tokens.css` defines POS-specific CSS custom properties (colors, spacing, touch targets) separate from F&B design tokens. POS animations in `pos-animations.css`. Both imported in the POS layout.
336. **POS offline queue and sync are typed but not yet wired** — `apps/web/src/lib/pos-offline-queue.ts` and `pos-offline-sync.ts` define the offline operation queue and sync strategy as TypeScript implementations. V1 still blocks tenders when offline.
337. **Accounting CSV import flow is wizard-based** — `apps/web/src/components/accounting/csv-import-flow.tsx` and `import-wizard.tsx` provide a step-by-step CSV import experience for COA data. Maps columns, validates, previews, and creates accounts.
338. **Semantic module now exports SQL-mode types, streaming, and fast-path functions** — `packages/modules/semantic/src/index.ts` exports `generateSql`, `validateGeneratedSql`, `retrySqlGeneration`, `pruneForSqlGenerator`, `buildSchemaCatalog`, `retrieveFewShotExamples`, `tryFastPath` (deterministic regex-based intent resolution), `runPipelineStreaming` (SSE streaming pipeline), `checkPlausibility` (result grading), plus intelligence functions (`generateFollowUps`, `inferChartConfig`, `scoreDataQuality`). Also exports batch review, conversation analysis, cost analytics, experiments, regression runner, and safety engine from the evaluation submodule.
339. **PMS permissions are separate from core RBAC** — `PMS_PERMISSIONS` defines 30+ PMS-specific permissions across categories (properties, rooms, reservations, rates, guests, folios, housekeeping, reports, settings, channels, loyalty). `PMS_ROLE_PERMISSIONS` maps system roles to PMS permissions. Same pattern as F&B permissions (`pos_fnb.*`).
340. **Tailwind CSS v4 on Windows: CSS disappears (0 utility classes)** — Known intermittent issue where the dev server serves CSS with only the base reset layer (12KB) but zero utility classes (should be ~185KB). Root causes: (1) `.next` cache corruption from Windows EPERM file locks on `.next/trace`, (2) Tailwind v4 oxide native binary fails to load and WASM fallback returns 0 scan results on Windows, (3) Turbopack cache holding stale empty CSS. **Fix procedure**: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` → `rm -rf apps/web/.next` → `pnpm dev` → hard refresh browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R`). The `@source "../../"` directive in `globals.css` is REQUIRED for monorepo scanning — without it, Tailwind v4's PostCSS plugin finds zero source files. If CSS breaks after a clean restart, check `node -e "require('@tailwindcss/oxide')"` — if it fails, run `pnpm install` to restore the native binary. Never remove the `@source` directive.
341. **Windows EPERM on `.next/trace` — full server fix** — When the dev server crashes with `EPERM: operation not permitted, open '.next/trace'`, orphaned Node processes are holding the file lock. **Critical**: bash `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` CANNOT kill its own parent process tree — always use PowerShell: `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command 'Stop-Process -Name node -Force'`, then `sleep 3`, verify 0 processes, `rm -rf apps/web/.next`, restart. Running `next dev` (with or without Turbopack) on a partial `.next` directory causes cascading `middleware-manifest.json` / `routes-manifest.json` ENOENT errors. Always fully delete `.next` before restart.
342. **Never mix dynamic slug names at the same route level** — Next.js App Router requires exactly one dynamic segment name per path level. Having both `payment-processors/[id]/` and `payment-processors/[providerId]/` as siblings causes a fatal startup error: `You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path`. Pick one name and use it consistently for all routes at that level.
343. **CommonJS scripts in ESM packages must use `.cjs` extension** — When `package.json` has `"type": "module"`, any script using `require()` must be named `.cjs` (not `.js`). The `dev-prep.cjs` script in `apps/web/scripts/` was renamed from `.js` for this reason. Always check the package's `type` field before adding new scripts.
344. **Payment gateway credentials are AES-256-GCM encrypted** — `paymentProviderCredentials.credentialsEncrypted` stores encrypted JSON. Use `encryptCredentials()` / `decryptCredentials()` helpers from `packages/modules/payments/src/helpers/credentials.ts`. Never store raw API keys in the database.
345. **Payment provider resolution happens OUTSIDE the transaction** — read-only provider/credential/merchant lookup happens before entering `publishWithOutbox`. This keeps transactions short and avoids holding locks during external API calls. Pattern: resolve → enter transaction → idempotency check → call provider → record result.
346. **Per-operation idempotency on payment intents** — each void/refund/capture gets its own `clientRequestId` column (migration 0176). Unlike tender-level idempotency (one key per tender), payment intents track idempotency per operation type. Partial unique index excludes NULL values for backward compatibility.
347. **Never expose raw gateway decline codes to end users** — use `interpretResponse()` from `packages/modules/payments/src/services/response-interpreter.ts` which returns separate `userMessage` (safe for cardholder display) and `operatorMessage` (with raw codes for staff). The `SuggestedAction` type guides retry behavior.
348. **Surcharge settings use 3-level scoping** — queries must check terminal-specific → location-specific → tenant-wide settings (most specific wins). Each level uses a partial unique index with NULL-scoped columns: `(tenant_id) WHERE location_id IS NULL AND terminal_id IS NULL` for tenant-wide, etc.
349. **Role access scoping: empty table = unrestricted** — `role_location_access`, `role_profit_center_access`, `role_terminal_access` use an "open by default" pattern. A role with NO rows in `role_location_access` can see ALL locations. Adding ANY row restricts the role to ONLY those locations. This is the opposite of the permission model (additive on top of nothing).
350. **ERP workflow config uses cascading fallback** — `getWorkflowConfig()` checks: (1) explicit DB row for tenant+module+workflow, (2) `TIER_WORKFLOW_DEFAULTS` based on `tenants.business_tier`, (3) ultimate fallback (auto=true, userVisible=false). Always use the workflow engine, never query `erpWorkflowConfigs` directly.
351. **Destructured `.split().map()` results need default values** — `const [a, b] = str.split(':').map(Number)` can produce `undefined` if the string is malformed. Always use `const [a = 0, b = 0] = ...`. This applies to all destructured array results from `split`/`map` chains.
352. **Vercel Hobby plan only supports daily cron** — `vercel.json` cron schedule `"0 0 * * *"` is the only supported interval on Hobby. 15-minute intervals require Vercel Pro. The ERP `isWithinWindow()` function was designed for 15-minute intervals — with daily cron it only fires if close time is within 15 minutes of midnight.
353. **Modifier per-assignment overrides live on the junction table** — `catalog_item_modifier_groups` has `override_required`, `override_min_selections`, `override_max_selections`, `override_instruction_mode`, `prompt_order`. The same modifier group can behave differently on different items. When rendering in POS, always check the junction table first, fall back to the modifier group defaults.
354. **Always use explicit column selects, never SELECT * on tables with frequent additions** — commit `cdbf002` fixed a 500 error caused by `SELECT *` on modifier tables after migration 0183 added new columns. Drizzle queries that select all columns can break when new columns are added if the mapping type doesn't include them. Use explicit `.select({ id: table.id, ... })` for safety.
355. **Payment intents are mutable (unlike tenders)** — `paymentIntents.status` is updated through a state machine (created → authorized → captured → voided → refunded → declined → error → resolved). Validate transitions before updating. Tenders remain append-only — the `payment_intent_id` FK on tenders is the bridge.
356. **POS visibility resume pattern** — when the browser tab was hidden >30s and becomes visible, `usePOSVisibilityRefresh` in `pos/layout.tsx`: (1) proactively refreshes JWT if within 5min of expiry, (2) pings `/api/health` to warm Vercel serverless function, (3) dispatches `pos-visibility-resume` custom event. Any hook needing to refresh stale POS data should `addEventListener('pos-visibility-resume', handler)`.
357. **Customer cache is module-level singleton** — `apps/web/src/lib/customer-cache.ts` caches up to 500 customers with 5-min TTL. Pre-warmed on POS mount via `warmCustomerCache()`. Use `filterCustomersLocal()` for instant results, `searchCustomersServer()` as fallback when cache is incomplete. Survives React unmounts but NOT full page refreshes.
358. **POS display size uses CSS custom property** — `--pos-font-scale` set on POS layout root via `usePOSDisplaySize` hook. 3 sizes: default (1x), large (1.15x), xlarge (1.3x). Persisted in `localStorage('pos_display_size')`. All POS text that should scale must use `calc(var(--pos-font-scale) * base-size)`.
359. **ACH return codes have retry classification** — `packages/modules/payments/src/helpers/ach-return-codes.ts` classifies R01-R83 codes into categories (nsf, closed, invalid, unauthorized, admin, regulatory, other). Only R01 (insufficient funds) and R09 (uncollected funds) are retryable with a 2-day delay. All other return codes are terminal — do not retry.
360. **SuperAdmin timeline writes are fire-and-forget** — `void writeTimelineEvent({...})` is called AFTER the primary operation succeeds, with no `await`. Errors are caught and logged internally. Never use `publishWithOutbox` for timeline events — they are read model inserts, not domain events. Never let timeline failures break primary operations.
361. **SuperAdmin health snapshots use parallel `Promise.all`** — health scoring computes ~20 metrics per tenant. All metrics are fetched concurrently via `Promise.all`. Score starts at 100 with deductions (DLQ depth: -25, error rate: -20, unmapped GL: -10, etc.). Grade: A≥90, B≥75, C≥60, D≥40, F<40.
362. **SuperAdmin alert cooldown is per-rule, not per-tenant** — when a DLQ depth alert fires for Tenant A, the cooldown prevents the same rule from firing for ANY tenant during the cooldown window. This prevents alert floods but means simultaneous issues across tenants may only generate one notification.
363. **Intelligence services read from `rm_*` tables only** — all semantic intelligence services (anomaly detection, correlation, forecasting, etc.) read from CQRS read models, never operational tables. If a new metric needs analysis, ensure it's being populated into the appropriate read model first. Anomaly detection writes only to its own `semanticAlertNotifications` table.
364. **Agentic orchestrator has strict guardrails** — max 5 Think/Act/Observe steps, SELECT-only SQL validation, tenant isolation, total timeout. Each step is a separate LLM call — a complex question can consume 5x the tokens of a simple query. Monitor via existing semantic observability metrics.
365. **`tenant_business_info` is one-row-per-tenant upsert** — uses `ON CONFLICT (tenant_id) DO UPDATE` pattern. `updateBusinessInfo` only sets fields that were actually passed (`!== undefined`). Tax ID is stored encrypted and returned masked (bullet chars + last 4). Content blocks use `ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, block_key)` for per-block upsert.
366. **Year seed script is additive-only and deterministic** — `packages/db/src/seed-year.ts` uses `mulberry32(20260224)` PRNG. Running twice creates duplicate orders (no dedup). Always run on a clean DB after `pnpm db:seed`. Populates `rm_daily_sales` and `rm_item_sales` directly via ON CONFLICT upsert (bypasses event consumers). Supports `--remote` flag for production.
367. **Portal auth default password is `member123`** — `seed-portal-auth.ts` uses a pre-computed bcrypt hash. For production members, use `add-portal-member.ts` with a custom password. Portal auth accounts use provider `'portal'` with unique constraint on `(tenant_id, customer_id, provider)`.
368. **Settings navigation renamed** — sidebar nav for Settings → General now points to `/settings/general` (was undefined). Merchant services moved from `/settings/payment-processors` to `/settings/merchant-services`.
369. **Profit centers settings use single-fetch + client-side filtering** — `useProfitCenterSettings()` calls `GET /api/v1/profit-centers/settings-data` once, returns `{ locations, profitCenters, terminals }`. Use `filterProfitCenters()`, `filterTerminalsByLocation()`, `filterTerminalsByPC()` for instant filtering — never make separate API calls for each level. `useVenuesBySite()` builds the site→venue map via `useMemo`.
370. **Terminal selection uses single-fetch with role scoping** — `useTerminalSelection({ roleId })` calls `GET /api/v1/terminal-session/all?roleId=xxx` once, then derives `sites`, `venues`, `profitCenters`, `terminals` via `useMemo`. Role access filtering happens server-side via `role_location_access`, `role_profit_center_access`, `role_terminal_access` tables. Empty tables = unrestricted (gotcha #349 applies).
371. **Merchant services hooks use React Query** — all payment processor hooks (`usePaymentProviders`, `useMerchantAccounts`, `useTerminalAssignments`, etc.) use `@tanstack/react-query` with `staleTime: 15_000–30_000`. Mutation hooks auto-invalidate relevant query keys via `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`. Never use raw `useEffect` + `apiFetch` for merchant services data.
372. **`/settings` is a redirect, not a page** — `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` redirects to `/settings/general` via `router.replace()`. All settings content lives under specific sub-routes: `/settings/general` (6-tab layout), `/settings/profit-centers`, `/settings/merchant-services`, etc. Never put settings content directly in `/settings/page.tsx`.
373. **Impersonation safety guards throw 403** — `assertImpersonationCanVoid(ctx, amountCents)` blocks voids >$500, `assertImpersonationCanModifyAccounting(ctx)` blocks ALL accounting changes, `assertImpersonationCanDelete(ctx)` blocks ALL deletes during impersonation. All throw `ImpersonationRestrictionError` (code `IMPERSONATION_RESTRICTED`, HTTP 403). Check `isImpersonating(ctx)` for conditional logic.
374. **`getSettingsData` runs 3 queries in parallel inside `withTenant`** — the settings data query uses `Promise.all([locations, profitCenters, terminals])` inside a single `withTenant` call. All three queries share the same RLS-scoped transaction. Never run them sequentially or in separate `withTenant` calls.
375. **`getTerminalSelectionAll` fetches role access outside `withTenant`** — role access tables (`role_location_access`, `role_profit_center_access`, `role_terminal_access`) have no RLS and are fetched via global `db.query`. Entity data (locations, PCs, terminals) uses `withTenant` for RLS. Both run in parallel via `Promise.all`.
376. **New permissions require updates to THREE files** — when adding a new permission: (1) add to `PERMISSION_MATRIX` in `packages/shared/src/permissions/permission-matrix.ts` (source of truth), (2) add to the appropriate group/sub-group in `PERMISSION_GROUPS` in `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/settings/settings-content.tsx` (controls role manager UI), (3) add default role assignments in `packages/db/src/seed.ts`. If you skip step (2), the permission will exist in the system but won't appear in the role manager — users can't grant or revoke it. `PERMISSION_GROUPS` uses hierarchical sub-groups for large modules (F&B POS, PMS, Accounting, POS/Orders, Platform) — add new sub-groups when adding a new sub-module.
377. **Auth user cache is 60s TTL, max 200 entries** — `SupabaseAuthAdapter.validateToken()` caches `AuthUser` results in a module-level `Map` keyed by `authProviderId`. Eliminates 3 sequential DB queries (user, membership, tenant) on every POS request. Cache is bounded with FIFO eviction. On cold start the cache is empty (automatic invalidation). Never cache mutable state like order data — only slow-changing identity data.
378. **Location validation is cached in middleware** — `resolveLocation()` in `with-middleware.ts` caches `isActive` status per `tenantId:locationId` for 60s (max 500 entries). POS paths hit the same location repeatedly — cache prevents a DB query per request. Deactivating a location takes up to 60s to propagate.
379. **`publishWithOutbox` combines `set_config` calls** — when both `tenantId` and `locationId` are present, both `set_config` calls are combined into a single SQL statement to save one DB round-trip per write transaction. Always combine independent `set_config` calls.
380. **Place-and-pay uses a single-transaction fast path** — `apps/web/src/app/api/v1/orders/[id]/place-and-pay/place-and-pay-fast.ts` combines `placeOrder` + `recordTender` into one transaction, eliminating ~8 redundant DB round-trips (duplicate `set_config`, `fetchOrderForMutation`, `incrementVersion`, idempotency pairs). The fast path accepts `['open', 'placed']` order status to handle race conditions with preemptive placeOrder.
381. **POS audit logs are fire-and-forget** — `placeOrder`, `recordTender`, and other POS-critical commands use `auditLog(...).catch(() => {})` instead of `await auditLog(...)`. Audit writes must NEVER add latency to POS responses. Non-POS commands may still `await` the audit log.
382. **Terminal session uses 3-key lifecycle** — `oppsera:terminal-session` (localStorage, session data), `oppsera:terminal-session-confirmed` (sessionStorage, confirmation flag), `oppsera:terminal-session-skipped` (sessionStorage, skip flag). The provider only restores a cached session when the confirmed flag is present in sessionStorage. Login/logout clears ALL three keys from BOTH storages via the exported `ALL_TERMINAL_KEYS` array. This prevents stale sessions from persisting across logins and the "skip once, bypass forever" bug.
383. **Bootstrap partial-run recovery** — `bootstrapTenantCoa` now checks for BOTH settings AND accounts. If settings exist but accounts don't (partial run from a prior crash), it deletes the orphaned settings row and re-runs the full bootstrap. The `BootstrapWizard` frontend verifies `accountCount > 0` after bootstrap and uses `refetchQueries` (blocking) to prevent stale `isBootstrapped` state.
384. **Accounting settings route returns 404 when unconfigured** — `GET /api/v1/accounting/settings` returns 404 with `"Accounting not configured — run bootstrap first"` when no settings row exists, instead of `{ data: null }`. Frontend uses this to show the bootstrap wizard.
385. **API routes should map field names between backend and frontend** — backend queries return DB-native field names; API routes translate them to the frontend contract. Example: PMS `getManagerFlashReport` returns `occupiedRooms` but the API responds with `roomsOccupied`. This decouples the DB schema from the API contract.
386. **POS commands use `Promise.all` for parallel data fetching** — `placeOrder` now fetches lines, charges, and discounts concurrently. `recordTender` fetches existing tenders and reversals concurrently. Always use `Promise.all` for independent queries within a transaction.
387. **Dark mode uses opacity-based colors, never `dark:` prefixes** — status badges use `bg-{color}-500/10 text-{color}-500 border-{color}-500/30`. Hover states use `hover:bg-gray-200/50`. Backgrounds use `bg-surface` (never `bg-white`). Dynamic colors use static lookup objects (not template literals). See CONVENTIONS.md §145 for the full conversion table.
388. **Admin portal uses fine-grained permissions** — admin API routes use specific permissions like `tenants.detail.view`, `tenants.detail.manage`, `events.dlq.view` — not broad ones like `tenants.view` or `tenants.edit`. Always prefer the most specific permission for each operation.
389. **F&B Host Stand uses compact, information-dense layout** — StatsBar uses grouped flex (not grid), values are `text-sm`, labels are `text-[9px]`. Waitlist cards show rank numbers. Actions are role-stratified: primary (solid green), secondary (outlined), tertiary (icon-only 34x34px). Metadata shows as chips. Count badges hidden when zero. Left/right split is 42/58%.
390. **Admin dead letter page supports batch operations** — checkbox selection on failed items, "Select All" scoped to current filter, batch retry/discard with loading state. Only actionable items (status=failed) get checkboxes.
391. **Admin dead letter detail uses collapsible sections** — Error Message (default open), Stack Trace (collapsed), Event Payload (collapsed with copy button), Retry History (default open with color-coded dots + admin names).
392. **Admin API key management** — `GET /api/v1/tenants/[id]/api-keys` computes status (revoked/expired/disabled/active) in SQL via `CASE` expression. Revoke adds `AND revoked_at IS NULL` guard and returns 404 if already revoked. Status is computed, never stored.
393. **PMS queries resolve display names via JOINs** — `getHousekeepingProductivity` LEFT JOINs `pmsHousekeepers` for housekeeper names. `getRevenueByRoomType` fetches room inventory counts for occupancy denominator. Always resolve display names in the query, not in the API route.
394. **AI Tools hub uses tabbed lazy-loading** — `/insights/ai-tools` page renders 7 tabs (Watchlist, Analysis Tools, Scheduled Reports, Lenses, Embeds, Authoring, History) where each tab content is loaded via `next/dynamic` from sibling insight sub-pages. Passes `embedded` prop to suppress standalone page chrome.
395. **Admin global user search** — `/users/global` page provides cross-tenant user search with text/status/lock filters, slide-over detail panel (500px), and action buttons (Lock/Unlock, Force PW Reset, Reset MFA, Revoke Sessions) with confirmation dialogs. Uses `useAdminUserSearch`, `useAdminUserDetail`, `useAdminUserActions` hooks.
396. **Admin tenant API keys tab** — `ApiKeysTab` component displays tenant API keys with masked prefixes, status badges (active/expired/revoked), and per-key revoke buttons. Uses `useApiKeys(tenantId)` hook.
397. **`signOut()` must use `'local'` scope, never `'global'`** — calling `supabase.auth.admin.signOut(userId, 'global')` revokes ALL sessions for that user across all devices. If one device logs out, every other device gets cascading 401s. Always use `supabase.auth.signOut()` (which defaults to local scope) or pass `'local'` explicitly.
398. **Cross-tab refresh token coordination** — Supabase rotates refresh tokens on use. If two tabs race to refresh, only the first wins and the old token is invalidated. The losing tab must detect that localStorage was already updated by the winner and use the fresh tokens instead of retrying with the now-invalid old token.
399. **Circuit breaker on `apiFetch` prevents retry storms** — after 15 failures in 30s sliding window, `apiFetch` short-circuits for 5s returning `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`. `fetchMe()` respects the circuit breaker. Never lower the threshold below 10 — a single dashboard page fires 5-10+ concurrent API calls, so transient hiccups can trip it.
400. **`recordTenderSchema.amountGiven` minimum is 1, not 0** — a 0-cent tender is never valid. The min was changed from 0 to 1 after PaymentPanel created ghost 0-cent tenders with GL entries. `placeAndRecordTender` also has a defense-in-depth guard for `amountGiven <= 0`.
401. **Never fire preemptive place-and-pay on PaymentPanel mount** — this creates race conditions with the user's actual payment click. The place-and-pay fast path handles open orders atomically. Let the user's click trigger the single API call.
402. **Move event enrichment queries outside FOR UPDATE transactions** — category names, modifier groups, and other read-only enrichment data should be fetched BEFORE or AFTER the transaction, not while holding the row lock. No consumer uses enrichment data that must be consistent with the lock.
403. **`instrumentation.ts` must use `Promise.all` for critical imports** — sequential `await import()` calls serialize cold start. Group independent module imports into `Promise.all`. Defer non-critical consumers (golf, PMS, F&B reporting) to background after critical path completes.
404. **`GET /api/health/light` returns without DB check** — use for load balancers and uptime monitors. Saves a pool connection per ping. `GET /api/health` still does the full DB health check.
405. **Frontend permission hooks must share a single fetch** — `usePermissionsContext()` reads from `PermissionsProvider` in the dashboard layout. Never create independent `usePermissions()` calls (each fires its own API request). Same pattern for `useEntitlements()` with 60s module-level cache.
406. **Settings page tabs must be lazy-loaded** — `RolesTab`, `ModulesTab`, `DashboardSettingsTab`, `AuditLogTab`, and `UserManagementTab` use `next/dynamic` in `settings-content.tsx`. Without this, the 1,355-line bundle loads on initial settings page visit.
407. **`/settings` redirect is server-side** — `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` uses Next.js `redirect('/settings/general')`, not client-side `router.replace()`. Zero JS overhead.
408. **Consolidated action routes use `[action]` dynamic segment** — 43 individual action routes (e.g., `/accounts/[id]/deactivate`, `/accounts/[id]/merge`) collapsed into 14 dynamic `[id]/[action]/route.ts` handlers with switch dispatch. All URLs preserved. Each action branch has its own permission check. Pattern: `const action = params.action;` then `switch (action) { case 'deactivate': ... }`.
409. **Usage tracker must use `db.transaction()`, never manual `BEGIN/COMMIT`** — manual `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` via separate `db.execute()` calls route each statement to a different pooled connection, leaving connections stuck in open/aborted transactions. With `max: 2` pool, this cascades to total DB failure. Always use `db.transaction(async (tx) => { ... })`.
410. **Usage tracker checks table existence before flushing** — if migration 0203 hasn't been run, the tracker discards its buffer and stops the timer instead of growing the buffer forever.
411. **Feature flags use dual-table pattern** — `feature_flag_definitions` (system-wide registry, `tenant_id IS NULL`) + `tenant_feature_flags` (per-tenant overrides with value JSONB). Definitions are seeded by admins, not by migration.
412. **Narrative template uses `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens** — `semantic_narrative_config` stores customizable prompts. `getNarrativeTemplate()` resolves placeholders at runtime. 5-min in-memory cache. Reset to default by DELETE + re-seed.
413. **A11y dialog hooks must be used on all portal-based dialogs** — `useDialogA11y(ref, isOpen)` sets `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, activates focus trap, and hides body children. `useFocusTrap` supports nested traps via stack. `announce()` sends screen-reader notifications via `aria-live` region.
414. **ESLint jsx-a11y rules are tiered** — 15 error rules (hard failures: `aria-props`, `alt-text`, `heading-has-content`, `tabindex-no-positive`, etc.) + 13 warning rules (soft: `click-events-have-key-events`, `label-has-associated-control`, `no-autofocus`). `anchor-is-valid` is off (conflicts with Next.js `<Link>`).
415. **Permission groups must be updated when adding permissions** — `apps/web/src/components/settings/permission-groups.ts` defines the `PERMISSION_GROUPS` array that controls the role manager UI. Uses hierarchical sub-groups for large modules. New permissions not in this file won't appear in the role editor. Uses `getAllGroupPerms()`, `getPermLabel()`, `getPermMeta()` helpers.
416. **POS `addItem()` is synchronous, not async** — `usePOS.addItem()` returns `void` (not a Promise). It creates an optimistic temp line (`id='temp-...'`) immediately for instant UI feedback, then queues the item for batch flush. Never `await addItem()` — it blocks nothing.
417. **POS uses 50ms debounce batch for line items** — rapid `addItem()` calls accumulate in `batchQueue.current[]`. After 50ms of inactivity OR when the queue hits 20 items (`BATCH_MAX_SIZE`), `flushBatch()` fires a single `POST /api/v1/orders/{orderId}/lines/batch` request. Temp line IDs are replaced with server-returned IDs on response. Constants: `BATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS = 50`, `BATCH_MAX_SIZE = 20`.
418. **Batch line item API request shape** — `POST /api/v1/orders/[id]/lines/batch` accepts `{ items: [{ catalogItemId, qty, modifiers, specialInstructions, selectedOptions, priceOverride, notes, clientRequestId }] }` and returns `{ data: { order, lines } }`. Max 20 items per batch.
419. **Member portal is dark-mode only** — `apps/member-portal/src/app/globals.css` sets `color-scheme: dark` on `:root`. There is no light mode. The portal uses a Tailwind v4 `@theme` block (lines 6-23) to map color tokens to CSS custom properties (`--color-surface`, `--color-background`, `--color-accent-foreground`, etc.).
420. **Host V2 wait-time estimator is a pure function** — `computeWaitTime()` in `packages/modules/fnb/src/services/wait-time-estimator.ts` takes pre-fetched data (turn times, occupancy, upcoming reservations, party size) and returns `{ estimatedMinutes, confidence, factors }`. No DB access. If `netAvailable > 0`, returns 0 (table available now). Otherwise: `avgTurnTime * (turnsNeeded / divisor)`, rounded to nearest 5 minutes, clamped 5–120 range.
421. **Host V2 wait-time confidence thresholds** — `getConfidence(dataPointCount)`: `>=50` data points = high, `>=20` = medium, `>=10` = low, `<10` = default (uses system-wide averages). Confidence is exposed in the API response so the host can judge estimate reliability.
422. **Host V2 table assigner uses 4-factor weighted scoring** — `scoreTable()` in `packages/modules/fnb/src/services/table-assigner.ts` computes: capacity fit (0.40 weight), seating preference match (0.25), server load balance (0.20), VIP preference (0.15). Each component returns 0–1.0. Returns top 3 suggestions sorted by score descending.
423. **Host V2 table combination penalty is 0.85x** — when two adjacent combinable tables are paired to seat a large party, the combined score is multiplied by `COMBINATION_PENALTY = 0.85`. This makes single-table seating preferred over combinations when capacity allows.
424. **Guest tokens are 8-char base64url** — `host-helpers.ts` generates tokens via `randomBytes(6).toString('base64url').slice(0, 8)`. 48 bits of entropy (6 random bytes), alphanumeric + `-_` character set. Used for guest waitlist tracking and notification URLs.
425. **Logout deduplication uses module-level promise** — `let _logoutPromise: Promise<void> | null = null` in `use-auth.ts`. If a logout is already in progress, subsequent calls `await _logoutPromise` instead of starting a new one. Prevents race conditions where concurrent logouts clear tokens set by an intervening login. Always reset to `null` in `finally`.
426. **SMS provider uses singleton with test override** — `getSmsProvider()` returns `TwilioSmsProvider` if both `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` + `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` env vars exist, otherwise `ConsoleSmsProvider` (logs to console). `setSmsProvider(provider)` allows test injection. Twilio provider uses HTTP POST with Basic Auth.
427. **Select component has full ARIA combobox pattern** — `apps/web/src/components/ui/select.tsx` uses `role="combobox"` with `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-controls={listboxId}` (via `useId()`). Dropdown uses `role="listbox"`, options use `role="option"` with `aria-selected`. Tag remove buttons have `role="button"` + `tabIndex={0}` + `aria-label`. All decorative icons use `aria-hidden="true"`.
428. **Global CSS skip-link pattern** — `globals.css` defines `.skip-link` positioned off-screen (`left: -9999px`), brought into view on `:focus` (`left: 1rem, top: 1rem`, z-index 999). Add `<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to content</a>` as first child of `<body>`.
429. **Global focus-visible ring uses semantic token** — `*:focus-visible` in `globals.css` applies a 2px outline at 2px offset using `--sem-ring` (#2563eb blue). Excludes elements already using Tailwind `focus-visible:ring-*` classes to avoid double-ring styling.
430. **`prefers-reduced-motion` disables all animations globally** — `globals.css` media query sets `animation-duration: 0.01ms !important`, `transition-duration: 0.01ms !important`, and `scroll-behavior: auto` on all elements and pseudo-elements. Applied unconditionally — never override with `!important` animation styles.
431. **All ERP/accounting report pages MUST follow the Modern ERP Report UX Standard** — defined in CONVENTIONS.md §175. Reference implementation: `gl-code-summary-content.tsx`. Every report page must include: (1) 4 KPI summary cards (icon + label + value + accent), (2) status/balance banner (green/red conditional), (3) collapsible sections with colored dots + count badges + chevrons + subtotals, (4) net/variance column, (5) in-report search filter, (6) Expand All / Collapse All controls, (7) Print button + `print:hidden` on controls + dedicated print header, (8) Export CSV button, (9) structured loading skeleton (KPI grid + table rows), (10) empty state with domain icon, (11) mobile card layout with tappable sections, (12) grand total footer with `border-t-2`. All monetary values use `tabular-nums` + `formatAccountingMoney()`. Section state uses `useState<Set<string>>` for collapsed tracking. Dark mode compliant (no `bg-white`, no `dark:` prefixes). Print uses `print:border-gray-300`, `print:bg-gray-100`, `print:break-inside-avoid`.
432. **Discount classifications use dual GL treatment** — `discount_gl_mappings` table maps `(tenant_id, sub_department_id, discount_classification)` to a GL account. Use `getDiscountGlTreatment(classification)` to determine if a discount is contra-revenue (reduces reported revenue) or expense (business absorbs cost). 15 contra-revenue types (4100–4114) + 9 expense types (6150–6158). Backfill existing data via `tools/scripts/backfill-discount-classifications.ts`.
433. **KDS settings use 4 new tables** — `fnb_kds_bump_bar_profiles` (button→action mappings), `fnb_kds_alert_profiles` (per-station audio/visual alerts), `fnb_kds_performance_targets` (speed-of-service goals per station + order type), `fnb_kds_item_prep_times` (per-item per-station prep estimates). Constants in `packages/shared/src/constants/kds-settings.ts`. 5 screen communication modes control multi-station behavior.
434. **KDS station routing is deterministic** — `resolveStation()` in `packages/modules/fnb/src/helpers/resolve-station.ts` resolves target KDS station per item via routing rules (sub-department → rule → station). Respects `allowed_order_types` and `allowed_channels` filters. Returns null if no valid station. Course sent consumer uses `kds-course-{tabId}-{courseNumber}-{stationId}` for idempotent ticket creation.
435. **Semantic metrics/dimensions now support tenant scope** — migration 0210 adds `tenant_id` to `semantic_metrics` and `semantic_dimensions` with dual-scoped unique indexes. System entities (`tenant_id IS NULL`) coexist with tenant-custom entities. Same pattern as `semantic_lenses`. Custom metrics/dimensions take priority in lookups.
436. **PII masking is two-layer** — `packages/modules/semantic/src/pii/pii-masker.ts` applies: (1) column-name heuristics (exact + 40+ substring matches for name, email, phone, ssn, card_number, etc.), (2) value-pattern regex detection (emails, phones, credit cards, SSNs, IPs). Applied at query result → LLM boundary. Frontend receives unmasked data within app boundary.
437. **Admin backup uses DB storage on Vercel** — `platform_backups.compressed_data` (BYTEA, gzip-compressed JSON) stores backups when `storage_driver='database'`. Vercel's filesystem is ephemeral/read-only — never use `storage_driver='local'` on Vercel. `withAdminDb(callback)` in `apps/admin/src/lib/admin-db.ts` provides RLS bypass for cross-tenant admin queries via cascade: `SET LOCAL role = 'postgres'` → `supabase_admin` → `row_security = 'off'`.
438. **GL dimension indexes must be tenant-prefixed compound** — migration 0214 replaced single-column indexes on `gl_journal_lines` dimension columns with `(tenant_id, dimension)` compound indexes + `WHERE dimension IS NOT NULL` partial indexes. Multi-tenant queries filter by `tenant_id` first, so compound indexes with tenant as leading column are far more efficient.
439. **Inline modifier panel uses smart instruction suppression** — `InlineModifierPanel` auto-hides non/extra/on-side buttons for exclusive-choice groups (temperature, doneness, sizes, bread types, cooking methods, egg styles) via `shouldSuppressInstructions()`. Uses FnB design tokens, not Tailwind classes.
440. **`formatPhone` and `getInitials` are in `@oppsera/shared`** — `packages/shared/src/utils/format.ts` provides `formatPhone("5551234567")` → `"(555) 123-4567"` and `getInitials("John Smith")` → `"JS"`. Use these instead of inline formatting.
441. **GL balance queries MUST include `(jl.id IS NULL OR je.id IS NOT NULL)` guard** — when LEFT JOINing `gl_accounts → gl_journal_lines → gl_journal_entries` with `je.status = 'posted'` in the ON clause, non-posted entries (draft/error/voided) have NULL `je.*` but non-NULL `jl.*` values. Without this guard, their amounts silently corrupt balance SUMs. Applied to: `getAccountBalances`, `getTrialBalance`, `getBalanceSheet`, `getProfitAndLoss`. See CONVENTIONS.md §185.
442. **Event consumers must validate payloads with Zod `safeParse`** — replace raw `event.data as unknown as T` casts with Zod schema validation. Use `safeParse` (not `parse`) so consumers never throw on bad data (would cause infinite retry). Log parse errors with consumer name and event ID, then return early (skip event). See CONVENTIONS.md §186.
443. **POS adapter auto-creates accounting_settings via `ensureAccountingSettings`** — when `getAccountingSettings` returns null, the POS adapter calls `ensureAccountingSettings(db, tenantId)` which: (1) creates a minimal settings row, (2) auto-wires well-known accounts by number (49900, 2160, etc.), (3) guarantees a "GL Suspense" account (99999) exists as the ultimate fallback. GL posting should NEVER be silently skipped. See CONVENTIONS.md §187.
444. **GL rounding accounts must be expense or equity type** — `validateJournal` now warns when the rounding account is type 'revenue' or 'asset'. Posting rounding to revenue inflates income; posting to asset creates phantom balances. Always use an expense account (e.g., "Rounding Expense 6999") for GL rounding.
445. **Semantic fast path bypasses LLM for common queries** — `tryFastPath()` in `packages/modules/semantic/src/llm/fast-path.ts` matches unambiguous queries via regex patterns and returns pre-built `ResolvedIntent` without calling the LLM. Saves ~500ms latency and ~$0.003 per call. Returns `null` (falls through to LLM) when uncertain. Only add patterns for HIGH confidence matches.
446. **Semantic pipeline supports SSE streaming** — `runPipelineStreaming()` emits SSE events at each stage boundary. API route: `POST /api/v1/semantic/ask/stream`. Event types: `status`, `intent_resolved`, `data_ready`, `narrative_chunk` (progressive text), `enrichments`, `complete`, `error`. Frontend uses `ReadableStream` reader. See CONVENTIONS.md §190.
447. **Anthropic prompt caching via `systemPromptParts`** — `LLMCompletionOptions.systemPromptParts` accepts `Array<{ text: string; cacheControl?: boolean }>`. Mark stable parts (DB schema) with `cacheControl: true` for ~90% input token cost reduction. The SQL generator splits at the `## Context` boundary. See CONVENTIONS.md §191.
448. **LLM output validation uses Zod schemas** — intent resolver output is validated with `IntentResponseSchema.safeParse()` instead of manual `typeof` checks. Provides automatic defaults (`mode → 'metrics'`), value clamping (`confidence → 0-1`), and clear error messages. Apply same pattern to all structured LLM outputs.
449. **RAG few-shot examples are fetched once and passed downstream** — `retrieveFewShotExamples()` runs during intent resolution; the snippet is passed to the SQL generator via `ragExamplesSnippet` on `ResolvedIntent`. Never fetch RAG examples twice. Diversity threshold (0.85) prevents near-duplicate examples.
450. **Plausibility checker validates query results** — `checkPlausibility()` in `intelligence/plausibility-checker.ts` grades results A-F with severity levels (info/warning/error). Checks include: negative revenue, impossible counts, unreasonable averages. Results are informational (never block the response). Include in `PipelineOutput.plausibility`.
451. **Close checklist detects GL posting gaps** — item #21 compares `COUNT(DISTINCT source_reference_id)` from `gl_journal_entries` against tender count for the period. Any mismatch is a `fail` status with detail message. Surfaces silent posting failures before period close.
452. **Incomplete payment type mappings use secondary fallback** — when a `payment_type_gl_defaults` row exists but its account fields are NULL, the POS adapter falls back to `settings.defaultUndepositedFundsAccountId` and logs `payment_type_incomplete:xxx` in missing mappings. Never silently skip posting because a mapping row exists but is incomplete.
453. **Never post GL debit and credit to the same account** — self-canceling entries inflate account activity with zero net effect. Always verify `accountA !== accountB` before posting memo-only tracking pairs (e.g., price override tracking). Skip both lines if accounts would be the same.
454. **All financial commands require `clientRequestId` for idempotency** — settlements, tip payouts, GL merges, and all other money-moving commands now include `clientRequestId: z.string().optional()` in their Zod schemas. Idempotency check and save MUST be inside the same `publishWithOutbox` transaction.
455. **Tag actions execute inside tag evaluation transactions** — `executeTagActions(tx, tenantId, customerId, tagId, trigger)` runs inside the same transaction as `applySmartTag`/`removeSmartTag`. Actions are configured per-tag in `tag_actions` table (migration 0219). Triggers: `on_apply`, `on_remove`.
456. **`LLMAdapter.completeStreaming` is optional** — adapters that don't support streaming fall back to `complete()`. The method yields text chunks via `onChunk` callback AND returns full `LLMResponse` when done (for caching/eval). The Anthropic adapter parses SSE `content_block_delta` events.
457. **`useSemanticChat` now supports streaming mode** — `sendMessage` auto-detects streaming support and uses `POST /api/v1/semantic/ask/stream`. The hook exposes `isStreaming` state (separate from `isLoading`). Narrative text is progressively appended to the assistant message via `narrative_chunk` SSE events.
458. **Zero-dollar orders log to unmapped events** — when `orderTotal <= 0` (fully comped orders), the POS adapter logs an unmapped event with `entityType: 'zero_dollar_order'` instead of silently returning. This provides visibility into orders that bypass GL posting.
459. **POS adapter logs CRITICAL when < 2 GL lines generated** — when fallback accounts fail completely (all defaults NULL), the adapter logs at `console.error` with `[pos-gl] CRITICAL` prefix and creates an unmapped event with `entityType: 'gl_posting_gap'`. This should never happen after `ensureAccountingSettings` guarantees a suspense account.
460. **Every financial event MUST have a GL consumer wired in `instrumentation.ts`** — the deferred accounting consumers block in `registerDeferredConsumers()` contains 40+ `bus.subscribe()` calls covering ALL financial event types. When adding a new financial event, you MUST: (1) create the GL adapter in `packages/modules/accounting/src/adapters/`, (2) export it from `packages/modules/accounting/src/index.ts`, (3) wire it in `instrumentation.ts`. A financial event without a GL consumer is a posting gap — transactions will occur without GL entries. See CONVENTIONS.md §201-§203 for the full checklist.
461. **GL adapter canonical pattern: ensure → get → log-if-missing → post** — every GL adapter follows the same 4-step pattern: (1) `try { await ensureAccountingSettings(db, tenantId); } catch { /* non-fatal */ }`, (2) `const settings = await getAccountingSettings(db, tenantId);`, (3) if settings is null: `await logUnmappedEvent(db, tenantId, { ... reason: 'CRITICAL: ...' })` + `console.error(...)` + `return`, (4) resolve accounts with fallbacks → `postingApi.postEntry(...)`. The entire function body is wrapped in try/catch that logs but never throws. This pattern is mandatory for ALL 15+ GL adapters.
462. **`gl_unmapped_events` is the universal audit trail for GL gaps** — every scenario where GL posting is skipped (missing settings, missing account mappings, zero-amount transactions, unknown payment types) MUST log to `gl_unmapped_events` via `logUnmappedEvent()` or direct `tx.insert(glUnmappedEvents)` (when inside a command transaction like retail close). The close checklist item #21 and the unmapped events dashboard surface these gaps. Never use `return` without logging first.
463. **Retail close GL posting uses direct `tx.insert(glUnmappedEvents)` — not `logUnmappedEvent()`** — because `postRetailClose` runs inside a `publishWithOutbox(ctx, async (tx) => { ... })` command transaction, it cannot use the adapter helper `logUnmappedEvent(db, ...)` (which creates its own connection). Instead, it inserts directly into `glUnmappedEvents` using the transaction handle `tx`. All command-level GL posting that runs inside a transaction must follow this pattern.
464. **15 GL adapters cover all financial event types** — POS (`pos-posting-adapter`), void (`void-posting-adapter`), return (`return-posting-adapter`), F&B (`fnb-posting-adapter`), voucher purchase/redeem/expire (`voucher-posting-adapter`), membership billing (`membership-posting-adapter`), chargeback received/resolved (`chargeback-posting-adapter`), folio/deposit/loyalty PMS (`folio-posting-adapter`), ACH originated/settled/returned (`ach-posting` in folio adapter), tender reversal + tip adjustment (`tender-reversal-posting-adapter`), drawer events (`drawer-event-posting-adapter`), customer ledger/transfer/wallet (`customer-financial-posting-adapter`), inventory receipt posted/voided (`inventory-receipt-posting-adapter`), comp + line void (`comp-void-posting-adapter`), drawer session close (`drawer-close-posting-adapter`), stored value issued/redeemed/voided/reloaded/transferred (`stored-value-posting-adapter`). All live in `packages/modules/accounting/src/adapters/`.
465. **Zero-amount events skip GL silently (the ONLY allowed silent skip)** — `if (data.amount === 0) return;` at the top of each adapter is the one exception to "never silently return". Zero-dollar transactions have no financial impact and produce self-canceling GL entries. All other skip paths MUST log to `gl_unmapped_events`.
466. **NEVER fire-and-forget DB operations on Vercel (CRITICAL)** — any `void someDbQuery().catch(() => {})` or unawaited Promise that touches the database is LETHAL on Vercel. After the HTTP response, Vercel freezes the event loop. In-flight DB queries become zombie connections stuck in `ClientRead` until `statement_timeout` kills them. With `max: 2` pool, 2 zombies = total pool exhaustion = login failure + all API errors. This caused production outages on 2026-02-27 and 2026-02-28. **All DB work must complete BEFORE `return NextResponse.json(...)`**. Use `try { await sideEffect(); } catch { /* log, non-fatal */ }` instead of `.catch(() => {})`. Pure in-memory fire-and-forget (e.g., `Map.set()`) is OK. See CONVENTIONS.md §205 for full rules.
467. **`instrumentation.ts` must NOT fire-and-forget DB queries** — the `register()` function runs on cold start. Fire-and-forget DB queries (like pre-warming the semantic registry cache) compete with critical-path requests for the `max:2` pool. If the cold start freezes, these connections become permanent zombies. Only `bus.subscribe()` calls (pure in-memory), `SELECT 1` warm-up (<10ms), and pure in-memory setup are allowed. Rely on SWR cache / lazy loading for cold start data.
468. **Login route must await ALL DB writes before returning** — the login route previously had 3 fire-and-forget chains: `resolveGeo().then(resolveUserIdentity().then(recordLoginEvent()))` for success, failure, and lockout paths. Each chain executes 2-3 DB queries after the response is sent. On Vercel freeze, these become zombie connections that block the NEXT login attempt — creating a cascading failure where login causes login to fail. Fix: either `await` the recording before returning, or remove DB writes from the hot path entirely.
469. **Post-transaction side effects must be awaited** — the pattern of `const result = await publishWithOutbox(...); someSideEffect().catch(() => {}); return result;` is dangerous on Vercel. GL posting, audit logging, and event publishing that happen after the main transaction must use `try { await sideEffect(); } catch { /* log */ }` — never `.catch(() => {})`. The POS adapter is exempt because it runs INSIDE event consumers (which complete before the outbox worker returns), not after the HTTP response.
470. **All DB access should go through `guardedQuery()` or `withTenant()`** — `guardedQuery()` in `pool-guard.ts` provides concurrency limiting (semaphore), circuit breaker (10s fail-fast after pool exhaustion), slow query logging (>5s), and queue depth warnings. `withTenant()` wraps through `guardedQuery` automatically. Modules that bypass this (raw `db.select()`, `db.execute()`, `db.transaction()`) skip all pool protection. Known violators that need fixing: semantic registry (`db.select()`), usage tracker (`db.transaction()`), outbox worker (`db.execute()`).
471. **Usage tracker must NOT use `setInterval` + fire-and-forget flush** — `setInterval` timers on Vercel are unreliable (process may freeze between intervals). When the timer fires, `flushBuffer().catch(() => {})` runs DB writes that may never complete. Fix: flush synchronously within the request lifecycle (e.g., at end of `withMiddleware`) or only when buffer reaches threshold, using `await`.
472. **Detecting Vercel pool exhaustion** — run `node tools/scripts/db-deep-diag.cjs` against production. Key indicators: (1) connections in "idle" state with `wait_event = ClientRead` (query completed server-side, client never read result), (2) connections held >30s on simple SELECT queries, (3) high total connections but 0 active and many ClientRead. Fix: kill stuck PIDs via `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)`, then find and fix the fire-and-forget pattern that caused them.
473. **Postgres timeouts must be set via `ALTER DATABASE`, NEVER via postgres.js `connection` param** — Supavisor (port 6543) rejects ALL connection startup parameters and kills the connection immediately. Setting `connection: { statement_timeout: '30s' }` on the postgres.js config caused a production outage (2026-02-27). Use `ALTER DATABASE postgres SET statement_timeout = '30s'` instead. The `db-deep-diag.cjs` diagnostic script verifies these settings.
474. **Git worktrees for multi-agent sessions** — use `pnpm wt:create <name>` to create an isolated worktree at `../oppsera-worktrees/<name>` with branch `agent/<name>`. Each worktree gets its own `.env.local`/`.env.remote` copy and `pnpm install`. Use `pnpm wt:remove <name>` to clean up (with optional `--merge` to merge back). Use `pnpm wt:list` to see active worktrees. CRITICAL: migration journal (`_journal.json`) is shared across worktrees — always re-read the journal before creating a migration to avoid idx conflicts.
475. **Distributed locks for app-level workers** — `withDistributedLock(key, ttlMs, fn)` in `@oppsera/core` provides row-based distributed locks immune to Supavisor connection pooling (advisory locks don't work with Supavisor). Well-known lock keys in `LOCK_KEYS` from `@oppsera/shared`. ERP cron uses `LOCK_KEYS.ERP_CRON` with 14-minute TTL. Expired locks are cleaned by drain-outbox cron. Schema: `packages/db/src/schema/distributed-locks.ts`. Migration: `0247_distributed_locks.sql`. All lock DB calls go through `guardedQuery` for pool protection. `withDistributedLock` returns `null` when the lock is already held — always handle this case.
476. **Deploy script has file-based mutex** — `scripts/deploy-oppsera.cjs` creates `.deploy.lock` (JSON with PID, timestamp, branch, user) at repo root. Second deploy attempt checks PID liveness + 30-minute stale timeout before aborting or overriding. Lock auto-cleans on process `exit`/`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`. GitHub Actions concurrency groups also prevent concurrent CI (`cancel-in-progress: true`) and deploys (`cancel-in-progress: false` = queued).
477. **Pool Guard wraps all DB queries** — `guardedQuery(fn, label?)` in `packages/db/src/pool-guard.ts` provides: (1) semaphore concurrency limiting (default max 2), (2) per-query timeout (default 25s), (3) circuit breaker (10s fail-fast after pool exhaustion), (4) single-flight deduplication for identical concurrent queries, (5) TTL jitter on cache entries to prevent thundering herd, (6) zombie connection tracking and forced termination. All `withTenant()` calls go through `guardedQuery` automatically. For direct DB access, use `guardedDb` proxy (exported from `@oppsera/db`) instead of raw `db`. In tests, mock `pool-guard.ts` to pass through: `vi.mock('@oppsera/db/pool-guard', () => ({ guardedQuery: (fn: any) => fn(), guardedDb: db }))`.
478. **Step-up authentication for sensitive operations** — `requireStepUp(ctx, category)` in `packages/core/src/auth/step-up.ts` validates an HMAC-SHA256 signed token from the `X-Step-Up-Token` header. Tokens are category-specific with configurable TTLs: `financial` (5min), `security` (3min), `destructive` (2min), `admin` (10min). Frontend flow: sensitive action → PIN modal → `POST /api/v1/auth/step-up` with PIN → receive signed token → retry original request with `X-Step-Up-Token` header. Tokens are single-use when `singleUse: true` (default for destructive). Never log or cache step-up tokens.
479. **Bot detector uses weighted scoring** — `detectBot(req)` in `packages/core/src/security/bot-detector.ts` scores requests on: request frequency (weight 0.3), 4xx error ratio (0.25), suspicious User-Agent patterns (0.25), sequential path scanning (0.2). Threshold: score > 0.7 = likely bot. Uses LRU cache (max 5K entries) keyed by IP+UA hash. Returns `{ isBot, score, factors }`. Never block bots at the middleware level — log and rate-limit instead.
480. **Replay guard validates nonces on high-risk mutations** — `validateReplayGuard(req)` in `packages/core/src/security/replay-guard.ts` checks `X-Request-Nonce` (UUID v4) + `X-Request-Timestamp` headers. Rejects: missing headers, timestamp > 5min old, duplicate nonce (LRU cache, 10K entries, 10min TTL). Apply to financial mutations (tender, void, refund, GL posting) but NOT to idempotent GETs or low-risk POSTs. Frontend: `generateNonce()` in `apps/web/src/lib/nonce.ts`.
481. **Receipt engine uses builder pattern** — `new ReceiptBuilder(type).setHeader(...).addLineItems(lines).setPayment(tender).setFooter(settings).build()` returns a `ReceiptDocument`. Render via `ThermalRenderer.render(doc)` (ESC/POS), `PrintHtmlRenderer.render(doc)` (browser print), or `EmailHtmlRenderer.render(doc)` (email). Builder validates required sections per receipt type. Types: `sale`, `void`, `return`, `check`, `gift_receipt`. All renderers in `packages/shared/src/receipt-engine/renderers/`.
482. **Receipt links use secure tokens** — `receipt_links` table (migration 0232) stores tokenized public receipt URLs. Tokens are 32-char base64url, expire after configurable TTL (default 30 days). View counts tracked on `receipt_links.view_count`. Rate limit: 1 email per session. Public routes under `/(guest)/r/[token]/` require no authentication.
483. **`guardedDb` proxy replaces raw `db` for direct queries** — `packages/db/src/pool-guard.ts` exports `guardedDb`, a Proxy wrapping `db` that routes all `.select()`, `.insert()`, `.update()`, `.delete()`, `.execute()` calls through `guardedQuery()`. Use `guardedDb` anywhere you need direct DB access outside `withTenant()`. Import: `import { guardedDb } from '@oppsera/db'`. This ensures pool protection, timeouts, and circuit breaking on ALL database operations.
484. **PMS-POS room charge uses `PmsReadApi`/`PmsWriteApi` singletons** — `packages/core/src/helpers/pms-read-api.ts` and `pms-write-api.ts` define cross-module interfaces for PMS integration. POS can look up guest folios via `getPmsReadApi().getGuestFolio()` and post room charges via `getPmsWriteApi().postFolioCharge()`. Same singleton pattern as `CatalogReadApi`, `OrdersWriteApi`, `AccountingPostingApi`. Wired in `apps/web/src/lib/pms-bootstrap.ts`.
485. **Register tab sync uses BroadcastChannel + SSE** — `apps/web/src/lib/tab-sync-channel.ts` provides cross-tab sync via `BroadcastChannel('oppsera-tab-sync')` for same-browser tabs, and `apps/web/src/lib/tab-sync-sse.ts` provides SSE for cross-device sync via `GET /api/v1/tab-sync/events`. Mutations include a `version` field — receivers compare versions and show conflict UI when behind. Offline mutations queue in `apps/web/src/lib/pos-offline-tab-sync.ts` for replay on reconnect.
486. **Expense reports use lifecycle state machine** — `packages/modules/expenses/src/helpers/expense-transitions.ts` defines: `draft → submitted → under_review → approved → processing → reimbursed`, plus `rejected` (from submitted/under_review), `recalled` (from submitted). Terminal states: `reimbursed`, `rejected`, `recalled`. GL posting happens on `approved` transition (Dr Expense / Cr AP or Payable). Reimbursement GL on `reimbursed` (Dr AP / Cr Cash).
487. **Project costing uses cost allocation rules** — `packages/modules/project-costing/src/helpers/cost-allocator.ts` allocates costs to projects via configurable methods: `direct` (100% to one project), `percentage` (split across projects), `hours` (by time entries), `headcount` (by assigned team). GL posting: Dr Project WIP / Cr Expense Source. Profitability = Revenue - (Direct Costs + Allocated Overhead).
488. **Multi-currency GL entries store three amounts** — `gl_journal_lines` now has `transaction_amount` (original currency), `exchange_rate`, and `functional_amount` (tenant's functional currency). Balance queries always use `functional_amount`. Exchange rate lookup: `getExchangeRate(db, tenantId, fromCurrency, toCurrency, date)` with `exchange_rates` table. Close checklist includes FX revaluation warning.
489. **Revenue activity read model unifies cross-module revenue** — `rm_revenue_activity` (migration 0237) consolidates revenue from POS, F&B, spa, PMS, AR, guest pay, and stored value into a single daily-partitioned read model. 13 event consumers populate it. Query via `getRevenueActivity(tenantId, dateRange, filters)`. Always use this for cross-module revenue dashboards instead of querying individual module tables.
490. **Web apps registry drives settings page** — `packages/shared/src/constants/web-apps.ts` defines the `WEB_APPS_REGISTRY` with module metadata (key, label, icon, category, route, entitlement). The settings web-apps page at `/settings/web-apps` renders from this registry with entitlement-based filtering. When adding a new module, register it in `WEB_APPS_REGISTRY` to make it visible in settings.
