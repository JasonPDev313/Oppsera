ive completed the first two milestones. Here is the MD files: OppsEra — Claude Code Prompt Kit
What's In This Kit
FilePurpose`PROJECT_BRIEF.md`Context document. Paste at the TOP of every Claude Code session.`CONVENTIONS.md`Engineering standards. Commit to repo root after Milestone 0. Also paste into sessions when relevant.`MILESTONE_0_SESSION_1.md`Task prompt: monorepo scaffolding, Next.js app, all package stubs, Docker Compose`MILESTONE_0_SESSION_2.md`Task prompt: 13 core tables, RLS, seed data, integration tests`OppsEra_ERP_Platform_Spec.md`Full technical spec (2,200 lines). Reference document — don't paste the whole thing. Pull specific sections when building each module.
How to Use
Every session follows this pattern:

```
1. Open new Claude Code session (or /clear)
2. Paste PROJECT_BRIEF.md
3. Update the "Current Project State" section at the bottom
4. Paste the task-specific prompt (e.g., MILESTONE_0_SESSION_1.md)
5. Let Claude build
6. Verify the checklist at the bottom of the prompt
7. Fix any issues
```

Why the Project Brief matters:
Claude Code starts every session with zero memory. If you paste "build me a Drizzle schema with these tables," it doesn't know:
* That you're building a multi-tenant ERP
* That every table needs tenant_id and ULIDs
* That RLS is defense-in-depth
* That events use a transactional outbox
* That modules can't import from each other
* What the folder structure looks like
The Project Brief gives Claude all of this context in ~200 lines. It's the difference between Claude making 50 architecture decisions on its own (many wrong) vs. Claude following YOUR architecture.
Updating the Project Brief:
After each milestone, update the "Current Project State" section. For example, after Milestone 0:

```
## Current Project State

Milestone 0 is complete. The monorepo is scaffolded with:
- apps/web: Next.js 15, dashboard layout with sidebar, health check API
- packages/core: Interface stubs for auth, permissions, entitlements, events, audit, config, billing
- packages/shared: EventEnvelope type, API types, money/date/ULID utils, pagination schema
- packages/modules: Stubs for catalog, orders, payments, inventory, customers, marketing, kds, golf-ops, reporting
- packages/db: Drizzle client with withTenant wrapper, 13 core tables, RLS on all tenant-scoped tables
- Seed data: "Sunset Golf & Grill" tenant with 2 locations, 1 admin user, 5 roles, 7 entitlements
- All tests pass including RLS isolation tests
```

For future milestones:
You'll create task prompts the same way. Always structured as:
1. Brief context (what exists now, from the Project Brief)
2. Specific task (what to build in this session)
3. Exact specifications (schemas, interfaces, event contracts)
4. Verification checklist (how to know it's done)
Pull the relevant section from `OppsEra_ERP_Platform_Spec.md` and adapt it into a task prompt. Don't paste the entire 2,200-line spec — Claude works best with focused, scoped instructions.
